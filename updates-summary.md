# Project Update Summary

Here is a concise, human-readable recap of all the major changes and fixes applied during this session.

1. **RAG engine now checks local FAISS before falling back anywhere else.**  
   - Migrated from Pinecone/Voiceflow to a local FAISS index using `faiss-node`.  
   - Kept the FAISS index flat (384-dim) and added retry logic: if a filtered query misses, it reruns without filters before resorting to any fallback message.

2. **Knowledge base consolidated and enriched.**  
   - Merged all supplemental data (`json_chunks.json`, web chunks) into a single `chunks.json` file and rebuilt the FAISS vectors.  
   - `kb/scripts/build-faiss-index.js` now carries rich metadata (topics, referenced products, features, use cases, etc.) so searches can match on more than just a single field.

3. **Smart routing became more forgiving.**  
   - Routing logic no longer relies on a perfect metadata match. Category filters now create an `$or` across category, document type, topics, keywords, tags, and referenced products.  
   - Added synonym checks with word boundaries, so phrases like “VMware alternative” or “pricing” still hit the right documents.

4. **Persistent caching made safer.**  
   - On startup we prune any cached answer that looks like a fallback (“I don’t have enough information…”).  
   - Prewarm now skips storing answers that come back without sources.  
   - Runtime cache ignores responses lacking supporting evidence.

5. **Talker got faster.**  
   - Swapped transcription to `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` for lower latency.  
   - Structured conversation handling so the avatar streams responses as tokens arrive, tracking TTFT and queueing speech segments.

6. **Operational tips to keep things smooth.**  
   - Delete `kb/persistent-cache.json` whenever you re-run the FAISS build, so stale fallbacks don’t reappear.  
   - After any metadata or script change: `npm run build:faiss`, then `npm start` to load the new index.
