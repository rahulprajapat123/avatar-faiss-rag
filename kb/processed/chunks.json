Were motivated by the desire to develop sustainable products that are invented for life that spark enthusiasm, that improve quality of life, and that help conserve natural resources, says Prahallad CR, head of technology & innovation at Bosch Digital Twin Industries. The point is always to take away complexity and make peoples jobs easier. It was this motivation that led Bosch Digital Twin Industries to recently develop a groundbreaking digital twin-in-a-box on integrated asset performance management (IAPM) solution. This tool enables organizations to create dynamic software models or twins of their physical industrial assets and continuously monitor them by using the combined advantages of edge and cloud. With edge AI-enhanced insights, users can predict failures, simulate scenarios, and make data-driven decisions, leading to reduced downtime, optimized energy use, and increased asset lifespan along with cost savings. Keeping large industrial assets running with maximum efficiency Bosch Digital Twin Industries focus on innovation and value creation has intensified as sectors embrace automation and digitization. Recognizing the challenges its energy production, utilities, and industrial manufacturing customers were facing in predicting and preventing unplanned maintenance, the company identified the need for an advanced asset management solution. As their machinery grew more complex, these customers were struggling to prevent surprise breakdowns and unexpected downtime in their large industrial assets such as mining conveyors and chemical reactors, wind power parks, energy grids, and more. That meant they were losing valuable time, money, and resources. Organizations also lacked the tools to identify inefficiencies and respond quickly to problems, risking costly disruptions along with negative impacts on overall productivity and profitability. In heavy industries such as steel, asset failures can likewise pose serious safety risks to employees. In response, Bosch Digital Twin Industries developed a digital twin-integrated IAPM solution specifically designed to optimize the operations of large industrial assets and prevent such risks. Imagine a machine that tells you what spare parts it will need in the next 30 or 60 days and interacts with you almost like a human would. Thats exactly what we make possible with our solution, says Prahallad.

Strategy Migrate workloads from existing data centers to a private cloud built on HPE GreenLake. Outcomes Establishes self-service functionality for customers Reduces provisioning times from weeks to days Optimizes energy costs through smarter infrastructure utility HPE DIGITAL GAME CHANGERS Self-service drives clients transformation plans Automation accelerates COMLINEs IT service delivery, setting new standards in business agility The last two years have demonstrated to businesses the importance of moving quickly on IT transformation projects. For IT service providers the challenge is enabling clients to access the services they need, quickly and efficiently. This means relentless automation while enabling clients to self-serve. Delivering business advantage through IT innovation Disruption caused by the COVID pandemic has meant a busy two years for the German IT service provider, COMLINE. Clients have been forced to bring forward their transformation plans and quickly adapt to the new circumstances. Proven IT expertise is at a premium. Were not one of the industry giants; were the hidden champion from Hamburg, says COMLINE COO, Ralf Schfer. But we grew 15% in services last year, twice as fast as the market. Revenues for 2020 were $90M. COMLINE is targeting $130M by 2025. Growth will come, Schfer says, through more customers realizing the fundamental potential of IT to transform their business. Customers of all sizesnot just enterprise class, want to learn more about service process automation, IoT, software development, or cloud delivery models. We see an opportunity to act as consultants, advising on Scrum methodology and agile working to build new digital products and services. We can help customers create new competitive advantages through IT innovation. COMLINE wants its client-facing teams to become more entrepreneurial. It also wants to streamline its IT infrastructure to create a more dynamic, scalable platform to grow. As part of this, COMLINE wants to migrate services out of its data centers into a new private cloud. This will build flexibility, scale, and commercial control while enabling German data to stay in Germany. This will fulfill the strategy that weve been pursuing for years, says Schfer, offering customers a real cloud experience from German data centers at competitive prices. HPE DIGITAL GAME CHANGERS Creating a breathing data center COMLINE will migrate its outsourcing data centers in Frankfurt and Berlin to the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. This will fundamentally transform how the business engages with clients, says Stojan Jarak, COMLINEs business unit director, creating a breathing data center. It includes a 40% capacity buffer to accommodate spikes in demand. The migration is made while maintaining COMLINEs continuity with the HPE ProLiant family of servers. The new HPE GreenLake private cloud is built on HPE ProLiant DL380 servers. The use of HPE StoreOnce then establishes efficient storage management. In tandem, these deliver performance and scalability with secure, simple to manage storage. Jarak says the upgrade is in line with COMLINEs commitment to achieve maximum performance out of its IT infrastructure. HPE GreenLake is more than a list of components; it is the big picture, he explains. It allows us to abstract the hardware and pivot to a service-oriented approach. We have more than 20 years experience of working with the HPE, and an affinity to ProLiant servers. The move to HPE GreenLake was a natural step. We see an opportunity to act as consultants, advising on Scrum methodology and agile working to build new digital products and services. We can help customers create new competitive advantages through IT innovation. Ralf Schfer, COO, COMLINE The 40% buffer is a practical, not theoretical, utility. COMLINE anticipates the buffer being in regular use, as it conducts proofs of concept with customers or tests new environments. The engagement with HPE allows COMLINE to then reassess baseline capacity, with a fast track to additional resources. With HPE GreenLake, we can increase and decrease our capacities just like changing the volume on a sound system, adds Schfer. HPE DIGITAL GAME CHANGERS Focusing on service innovation The engagement promises to transform the speed and delivery of COMLINEs services. The HPE GreenLake platform will form the basis of a more flexible, dynamic business, with the ability to accommodate a broad range of infrastructure demands. HPE GreenLake means we can have a new service in place with a new client, tested and ready to go within four weeks, says Jarak. This is a real competitive advantage and a world away from how things were done in the past. Previously, wed have had to order new hardware, wait for delivery, and only then start work. Delivery times were in excess of six months. The ability of the HPE GreenLake platform to absorb fresh demand means COMLINE avoids having to make long-term commitments to new hardware or take",

Delivery times were in excess of six months. The ability of the HPE GreenLake platform to absorb fresh demand means COMLINE avoids having to make long-term commitments to new hardware or take up a short-term leasing arrangement. Both scenarios would add cost and inflexibility. We are confident in our growth predictions, says Jarak. The agreement with HPE provides a capacity buffer with the promise of additional resources when needed. The bedrock of HPE ProLiant ensures we stay up to date with the latest in security, performance, and expandability. Ultimately, the engagement with HPE keeps us out of the logistics of IT and allows us to focus on the customer. Evidence of COMLINEs new approach to customer service is CACE, the COMLINE Any Cloud Environment. For clients, this acts as a gateway to a catalog of services run in the COMLINE data centers or public cloud. Clients can self-serve a range of functions, orchestrated by a ServiceNow ITSM integration; CACE then deploys the service request to the appropriate environment. The self-service approach has already produced stunning efficiency gains: event dispatching (98.4%), VM Linux deployments (53.9%), VM resource allocation (47.1%), and ticket handling (96%). It means our consulting and operations teams are removed from manual tasks and free to focus on providing our customers with the best possible solutions and services, says Schfer. The migration to the HPE GreenLake platform also underpins a more sustainable COMLINE. Jarak says German businesses already demand transparency on the sustainability credentials of their IT service providers. The sharp rise in energy costs means COMLINE needs to demonstrate how it is using energy efficiently. The business made a 5% saving in energy costs through 2021. He expects this figure to increase as COMLINE takes advantage of smarter cloud choices and more efficient HPE hardware. We can now make decisions on where to run workloads based on energy efficiency and to show these savings to clients. Also, automation removes manual interaction, says Jarak. Were running a highly efficient operation. According to Schfer, automation also allows COMLINE to invest in its most precious commodity: people. Our biggest challenge is finding and retaining skilled people. Its not only about money. You have to create the right culture for people to grow and to do great work. Automation provides the space for people to develop their careers. The agreement with HPE provides a capacity buffer with the promise of additional resources when needed.

    "text": "Data to the rescue of habitats Ducks Unlimited Canada goes hybrid to maximize its conservation efforts and resources The conservation and restoration of Canadian wetlands is a massive undertaking. Scientists need to know not only where those habitats are but also how factors like sunlight, temperature, and vegetation influence the delicate balance required to protect the population of waterfowl and other wildlife. Thats why Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) takes a sciencebased approach, leveraging data and technology to inform and track its conservation efforts on over 6000 acres across the country. With a hybrid cloud environment, the organization is making the most out of every data point, scaling AI models to accelerate insights, and expanding its positive impact. Customer story Customer: Ducks Unlimited Canada Industry: Research Country: Canada Data to the rescue of habitats | 2 Outcomes Delivers cost efficiency to process, store, and backup evergrowing geographic information system (GIS) data for conservation projects Powers machine learning to create comprehensive wetland mapping of Canada Allows to focus efforts on the highest impact areas and projects through data insights and seamless management Vision Maximize the positive impact of conservation efforts for Canadian wetlands and waterfowl Strategy Leverage a hybrid cloud strategy to enhance cost efficiency, accelerate data insights, and simplify IT operations Preserving habitats and life The environmental work of DUC goes beyond protecting waterfowl. Its efforts to conserve and restore wetlands and other habitats have a positive effect on entire ecosystems, the wildlife within them, and the communities and visitors of those areas. Were interested in climate resilience, carbon sequestration, water chemistry, and water quality. These ancillary benefits come along with protecting and restoring wetlands, says Andrew Pratt, director of information technology at DUC. The nonprofit conservancy organization has 500 staff and thousands of volunteers supporting scientific research and conservation projects through fieldwork, gathering and analyzing data, or fundraising. Science-based conservation Pratt shares one of DUCs core principles: We are a sciencebased organization. What we do and where we do it is constantly evolving as our science improves, so we can be very focused on the work that we do. An example of this sciencebased approach is DUCs decision support system. This comprehensive map helps identify the critical prairie areas to foster positive outcomes, including waterfowl breeding success, considering factors like grassland and wetland abundance. This information is then used to drive conservation policies and programs where efforts can be most impactful. All that science and knowledgebased information is backed by millions of data points. We manage 13,500 projects. We have over 6 million acres in our database, and its growing rapidly every year. Thats a lot of data that we have to protect, says Pratt. This data is used every day by field staff and management, so we have to make it readily available from any place. Wetlands are very dynamic. If you can collect data on a more continuous basis, you have a much deeper understanding of whats going on. That data is now starting to flow in through IoT devices into our data centers. Andrew Pratt, Director of Information Technology, Ducks Unlimited Canada [Place image here] A deep look into ecosystems To get a clearer picture of the state of ecosystems, DUC collects and analyzes a wide range of data on its GIS. Sources like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems, satellite imaging, and property boundaries help researchers and scientists go deeper than wetland location, telling a complete story of how habitats are transforming throughout the days, seasons, and years. Wetlands are very dynamic. The most valuable data tells us whats changing and when rather than taking a snapshot in time. Pratt explains. If you can collect data on a more continuous basis, you have a much deeper understanding of whats going on. That data is now starting to flow in through IoT devices into our data centers. Flux towers are one example. These devices monitor gas emissions on wetland complexes in a continual way. Scientists can then use that data to understand carbon storage processes within the ecosystem, and how these are influenced by factors like wetland vegetation abundance and temperature changes through the day and seasons. While data collection happens at the edge, all that information needs to be processed to gain true insights from it. Making donation dollars count As a nonprofit organization, DUC needs a strong fundraising strategy to get the expertise and technology it needs to achieve its objectives. Data can certainly help us evolve in the conservation space, but also in fundraising and marketing, Pratt states. For example, DUC can leverage zip code data to learn more about our supporter demographics and improve our marketing ROI. The organization must also find ways to drive efficiencies and maximize the value of every resource it gets. Thats why, when DUC needed to modernize its",

Thats why, when DUC needed to modernize its IT environment, it partnered with Hewlett Packard Enterprise to find a solution that aligns with its cloud strategy. We have to be extremely prudent in how were spending our unrestricted dollars. HPE GreenLake certainly helps when we can consolidate some of those costs. Andrew Pratt, Director of Information Technology, Ducks Unlimited Canada Data to the rescue of habitats | 3 Dollars are always hard to come by, and the ones we do get often have very stringent requirements on what can be spent on admin overhead, which includes IT, relates Pratt. We have to be extremely prudent in how were spending our unrestricted dollars. HPE GreenLake certainly helps when we can consolidate some of those costs. The right fit for every workload DUC follows a cloudfirst model, leveraging public cloud solutions for enterprise resource planning (ERP), HR, sales, and finance functions. This strategy enables scalable growth for the organization. Still, Pratt is aware of the workloads and data where public cloud is not a good fit. Cloud offers its benefits, but its not always the most costeffective, he explains. Our GIS workloads are very large datasets. Theyre shared across our field offices, theres a lot of transactional data. So, it makes more sense to run that in our own data centers. Thats what kickstarted this journey. That journeys destination was hybrid. By adopting HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition, DUC can run GIS and other workloads onpremises while still getting a cloudlike experience that is flexible, scalable, and easy to manage. The solution, which includes HPE Alletra dHCI and HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen11 Servers, delivers the storage, compute, and networking the organization needs to operate with efficiency. The solution is deployed at DUCs data centers located in Alberta and Manitoba and enables access to data and workloads across its 25 field offices and at the edge. I have a very lean IT team, so having HPE GreenLake Private Cloud Business Edition really makes the orchestration layer that much simpler. Everything is nicely displayed for us in one pane where I can easily see whats going on, Pratt states. In addition, HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen11 Servers deliver energy efficiency, resource consolidation, and high performance, supporting DUCs computational demands for diverse applications while aligning with the organizations sustainability goals. Intelligence-powered research As science and our knowledge evolve, so do the technologies that support them. DUC is taking advantage of machine learning to get more precise and faster insights. One of the use cases for machine learning is building a comprehensive inventory of all the wetlands in Canada, the only G7 country that doesnt have a complete national inventory. A wetland layer will help us understand where we are losing or gaining habitat. Using the old methodologies is very manual labor, and thats where deep learning AI tools are really coming into their own, Pratt shares. Data to the rescue of habitats | 4 These models are running on virtual servers through the HPE GreenLake cloud. The solution also enabled Pratt and his team to repurpose existing servers for computeheavy remote sensing GIS workloads, which also leverage deep learning tools. Pratt is also looking forward to other ways of adopting AI to maximize the value of the research data that DUC has amassed throughout more than 85 years of operations. Pushing our data to the cloud to run AI tools has made me quite nervous and has slowed our AI adoption because of privacy concerns, he says. If we can pull all that back and run AI on our own data centers, that is of great appeal to me. Security is top of mind Keeping all data and workloads secure has increasingly become a priority for Pratt and his team. Fundraising requires very sensitive data that falls under certain regulations and legislations. From a cybersecurity perspective, its our most valuable data, he explains. So, if I have a choice between sending my team to maintain and manage our storage arrays or implement the latest security tool, Ill take security every day. With simplified management and monitoring of its private cloud environment, DUC can focus its efforts and resources on highvalue tasks.

To meet the growing demand for faster, more accurate, and seamless services, diagnostic provider Medizinisches Labor Nord implemented a georedundant IT architecture to support continuous operations. The upgrade is enabling the laboratory to process 30% more samples and deliver results faster while protecting patient data. This leads to better patient care and a new capacity for growth. Ensuring continuity of crucial diagnostics Operational continuity is vital in medical diagnostics, where uninterrupted service is essential for delivering timely and accurate test results. As workflows increasingly rely on digital platforms for data processing and storage, laboratories like Medizinisches Labor Nord face risks from disruptions that can delay results and medical decisions. This reliability is especially important for Medizinisches Labor Nord because it handles high volumes of diagnostic samples and serves as a regional hub for its parent organization, laboratory diagnostics provider Sonic Healthcare Germany. Digitalization is very important in laboratory diagnostics right now to provide faster diagnoses and improve accuracy of results, says Stefan Schmidt, head of IT at Medizinisches Labor Nord. Recognizing the need for modernization, the laboratory identified opportunities to transform its operations. By implementing a georedundant IT infrastructure supported by a secondary data center, it has achieved 100% system availability and now processes up to 10,000 diagnostic samples daily while ensuring robust disaster recovery and secure data backups. We have a very high-performance system, and were now prepared for growth, shares Stefan Schmidt. Were no longer focused on what systems to use but instead on expansion and management. Future-proofing operations With an aging IT infrastructure, including outdated firewalls and fragmented storage, Medizinisches Labor Nord was increasingly vulnerable to disruptions. This made it difficult to manage growing volumes of data, adopt new digital healthcare technologies, and ensure continuous service delivery. The risks were very high, especially in the firewall environment, says Stefan Schmidt. We were constantly facing new requirements, often daily, that were difficult to implement within such an outdated setup. To safeguard operations and ensure future readiness, the laboratory worked with Hewlett Packard Enterprise and channel partner enthus Group to implement a centralized IT infrastructure at a dedicated facility. This overhaul combined operations from two smaller data centers into a hub equipped with modern disaster recovery capabilities and scalable systems.

This supports faster diagnostics, easier external collaboration with healthcare providers, and higher-resolution imaging. A single laboratory diagnostic file can be around one terabyte, explains Stefan Schmidt. These files contain sectional samples that must be visualized with precise zoom and macro functionality, which requires substantial processing power. If we cant deliver data fast enough, it becomes a bottleneck. Improving efficiency and capacity With increased speed and capacity, the laboratory can now process large files while maintaining high standards of service. It handles 8,000 to 10,000 diagnostic samples daily and has achieved up to 30% more throughput compared to its previous systems. Stefan Schmidt attributes this improvement largely to the new infrastructure, which is instrumental in accelerating the laboratorys automation efforts. The upgraded networking architecture ensures fast and reliable data access, supporting the labs automation systems. Our Roche (cobas) infinity system the largest ever setup in Germany relies on our new technology platform to manage complex diagnostic tasks, he says. This software solution coordinates workflows for automated diagnostic lines and helps us process large volumes of samples without any issues. He stresses the importance of speed and performance in controlling these workflows. With our current IT environment, we have the capacity and flexibility to scale as we need.

We can switch to our secondary data center when carrying out updates on our primary storage, which guarantees continuity for the lab and our services. Stefan Schmidt, Head of IT, Medizinisches Labor Nord Streamlining operations By consolidating fragmented systems into a unified architecture, Medizinisches Labor Nord has simplified its IT environment and reduced inefficiencies. This allows IT teams to focus on higher-value tasks instead of troubleshooting disparate systems. The new centralized management system also helps streamline operations and improves overall performance with HPE Aruba Networking Central offering unified network oversight to deliver reliable and secure connectivity. We dont have to worry about the infrastructure, and thats the most important point in IT, notes Stefan Schmidt. The system just runs continuously and performs without any major issues. Securing patient data Data security was another focus of Medizinisches Labor Nords modernization, given the sensitivity of patient information and diagnostic results. The laboratory upgraded its storage and switch equipment, deploying advanced encryption, secure access controls, and real-time monitoring. These measures not only protect data but also ensure compliance with industry regulations and data protection standards. I no longer worry about security since we upgraded to HPE Alletra Storage MP, says Stefan Schmidt. Its features secure our data, and weve eliminated concerns about service disruptions that used to affect our workflows. Building a scalable hub for future growth Looking ahead, Medizinisches Labor Nord plans to build on its centralized IT infrastructure to support the continued expansion of Sonic Healthcare Germanys network and improve operational efficiency. The scalability of its network architecture will be crucial in handling ever-increasing data demands, particularly as laboratory diagnostics drives the need for higher storage and processing capacities. With the addition of a new laboratory to the data center at its new facility along with future integrations of other labs Medizinisches Labor Nord is positioning itself as a central IT hub for the organizations northern region.

In this guide well take you into the innovative and exciting world of modular data center server design, and explain a key set of specifications and designs for modular hardware systems. Then, well explain what makes such modular hardware systems important and worthwhile, and what role HPE plays in this world. Next, well explore the role that a baseboard management controller plays in securing, protecting, and managing modular data center servers, after which well conclude with a look at how one major service provider is put- ting open modular server designs to work. This raises an interesting question: Whats driving the server mar- ket toward modularity? A surprisingly major convergence of design and development trends is underway, inspired at least in part by les- sons learned from transitioning monolithic, on-premises software and infrastructures into distributed, cloud-native architectures. Essentially, this means the disaggregation of server hardware follow- ing the model now typical for cloud-native software design, as shown in FIGURE 1. These same gains in agility transfer rather nicely from software to hardware. They come in similar fashion, too, by separat- ing individual subsystems into discreteincluding CPU and RAM, security, networking, storage, and power suppliesso that engineers can design them independently. Indeed, modular server design is an approach whose time has come, and is gaining momentum in hardware design circles. Its at least arguable that this approach is a natural evolution of overall sys - tems design, as depicted in FIGURE 2. Its also an approach that is of 7 interest to service providers, who have a keen interest in obtaining, using, and maximizing the return on their ever-growing investment in data centers. This not only reflects the growth of data centers for conventional and data-intensive workloads, but even for high-per- formance computing.

Thus, theyre one of the driving forces behind modular server design. That said, given that enterprises have the same needs for cloud services, AI workloads, and scalable infrastruc- tures, they too can benefit from this new design approach. All this helps to explain why modular server and data center designs sit cen- ter stage for industry initiativesled by the Open Compute Projects Data Center Modular Hardware System architecture and specifi- cations. In fact, they serve as the impetus for this Gorilla Guide! In Chapter 1, youll get a solid overview of this collection of modular server specifications and designs. 10 The Open Compute Project (OCP) is a global technology initia- tive that seeks to create more efficient, scalable, and sustainable hardware designs. It exerts a collaborative, industry-wide effort to develop open source, modular hardware solutions for data cen - ters, edge computing, and more.

The Impact of Modular Hardware Its hard to overstate the advantages of transforming data center hardware from monolithic, rack-mounted devices built around spe- cific CPU and memory architectures into something more modern and flexible.

This enables faster innovation, plus broader sourcing and support for those modules. Faster Time-to-Market: Because modules are common, reusable building blocks work in multiple designs for multiple markets. All are available at the same time, and work alike in various form factors and designs, so theres no need for separate, custom items. Compatible: Buyers can choose modules from multiple makers, and expect them to work together seamlessly. Likewise, multiple makers can support various form factors and designs. Overall, modular implementations let buyers pick the modules they need to support easy right-sizing for data center servers and their local infrastructures. Also, replaceable modules improve future-proofing for devices, because individual modules may be swapped out with ease, to take advantage of technology changes and CPU speed boosts. This is particularly compelling for power supplies, where improved efficiency provides immediate value. And finally, service providers and organizations can mix and match individual components to deploy modular designs within an open, well-defined, trusted technology ecosystem. All this said, the most important benefit by far is that disaggregation means modules are not tied to a monolithic development timetable. Thus, modules and related subsystems can evolve independently, so that enterprises and service providers can pick best-of-breed and optimally tailored components for their data center needs. OPEN COMPUTES DATA CENTER MODULAR HW SySTEM 14 Enterprises and service providers can customize to optimize costs, while zeroing in on tailored configurations to meet current and pro- jected workloads. Flexibility and a broad selection of components including compute (CPU+RAM), security, storage, networking, and morelets organizations achieve agility and obtain competitive advantage. As new modules incorporate new or improved technol - ogies, modularity means accelerated time to market and reusable designs. This makes it easier than ever before to deploy new services and hardware platforms at the same time. The OCP DC-MHS (sub)project aims to standardize and pro- vide interoperability between key elements of data center, edge, and enterprise infrastructure by offering consistent interfaces and form factors among modules. Interoperability also means interchangeability. OCP DC-MHS Overview and Guided Tour OCP DC-MHS is best understood as a collection of electrical and mechanical specifications, where the focus is on designing mod - ules that seek to improve efficiency, sustainability and scalability of data center servers, racks, and other related devices. In this Gorilla Guide, the emphasis is on the server parts of this framework and specifications. Ultimately DC-MHS lets engineering and related firmware and soft- ware teams concentrate in specific areas of functionality to push such designs ahead as quickly as they can. This speeds up, separates, and simplifies design cycles. By way of contrast, earlier server designs focused on CPU and RAM generations and architectures, with other systems proceeding concurrently in lockstep. Modularization fosters disaggregation, with each module type subject to its own develop- ment and update cycles. OPEN COMPUTES DATA CENTER MODULAR HW SySTEM 15 Within the DC-MHS framework and specifications, one can find designs and specifications for the following types of modules, some of which appear in FIGURE 5. M-HPM (Host Processor Modules): A set of designs for 2U and 4U servers that include one or more CPU sockets and various banks of RAM packages. Designs may incorporate one or more M-HPM modules, but must include at least one. In Figure 5, both M-FLW and M-DNO define various form factors for CPU/RAM packages ranging from 1U to 4U.

This module acts as gatekeeper to protect and secure servers; overall its part of the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) module family. M-CRPS (Modular Common Redundant Power Supply): A high-efficiency power supply design that works with multiple (two or more) instances to deliver reliable, scalable power in a compact form for flexible, reliable power delivery in data centers. M-PIC (Platform Infrastructure Connectivity): Standardizes connectivity between the HPM (and other modules) for power, cooling, and networking access (with options ranging up to 400 Gbps via SmartNICs and high-speed optical Ethernet). Overall, there are a lot of modules and sub-systems included in the Data Center Modular Hardware System specifications and designs. Be prepared to spend some time getting familiar with them, so you can really appreciate the strengths of this approach. Service providers and enterprises can take advantage of its standardization and interoper- ability to help them optimize data center operations, expand existing markets and occupy new ones. All this comes courtesy of the finely focused and tuned capabilities that DC-MHS brings to data centers. This chapter of the Gorilla Guide has covered the general benefits of modular server architecture and design. In Chapter 2, well explore what gives the Data Center Modular Hardware System its oomph and real value, especially as it pertains to development of certain mod- ules for which HPE might otherwise have to wait on CPU vendors for update windows. 17 The specifications and designs that make up the DC-MHS expand what system engineers and developers can do when building servers. In fact, DC-MHS lets them explore multiple design projects in parallel, each on its own separate timeline and basis. That means CPU and RAM modules (M-HPM) can proceed on one track, while each such module also gets a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) to bring in controls for BIOS/UEFI, FPGAs, and so forth. But at the same time, work can get underway on a separate DC-SCM for remote access, security, monitoring, and management, and likewise for storage modules, networking modules, power sup- plies, and even advanced functions modules (such as multiple GPUs for AI and other data and computationally intense workloads). Its important to emphasize that the DC-MHS specifications ensure interoperability (currently electrical and mechanical) between these modules. Modularity enables parallel design cycles so individual modules can proceed independent of one another. Thus, for example, HPE can develop custom security for iLO and firmware with a specific DC-SCM design without waiting on CPU vendors to provide new processors to define M-HPM modules. This effectively decouples development of CHAPTER 2 Why DC-MHS Matters Why DC-MhS MatterS 18 silicon-based security and firmware from CPU (and other) vendor release cycles. Because HPE leads the market in this space, this is a win for their engineersand their customers. Design One Time, Reuse as Needed Engineers can build modules to fulfill specific server functions, and then use those same modules in different configurations to meet different needs, workloads, or use cases. Decoupling modules for separate, discrete development, test, and deployment lets engineers focus on their specific areas of expertise and knowledge, and concen- trate on accommodating newer, faster, and more capable modules on their own schedules. This offers benefits for certain specific modules where new technologies get introduced on a rapid cadenceespe- cially true for hardware-based security, storage, networking, and connectivity modules (e.g., PCIe 6.0, which is out as of late 2024, and PCIe 7.0, currently in design-specification stages). Such technologies are especially helpful for servers where more, better, and faster links and buses establish important payoffs when advances get put to work sooner rather than later. HPE has been part of the OCP since 2015, and is a founding core team member of the DC-MHS project since it launched in 2022. OCP DC-MHS offers HPE vital opportunities to deliver its modular serv- ers, where it can take advantage of faster times to market for new modules and the related capabilities they bring to service providers and other data center customers. OCP DC-MHS vetting means that HPEs modular servers arrive in the market with a broad portfolio of pre-qualified options for the modules it builds into those servers most notably security, networking, CPU/RAM (DC-HPM), and related baseline controller modules. Why DC-MhS MatterS 19 HPEs Role in DC-MHS The company is contributing upstream with funding and engineering support for this project.

Phillip Leech, senior technologist/architect at HPE, leads the DC-MHS Modular Plug-and-Play (M-PnP) work- stream. This group focuses on creating standardized interfaces for seamless integration of modular components into OCP DC-MHS- compliant servers. The goal is to ensure interoperability between hardware modules within those servers, and to support their auto - matic discovery and automated configuration as theyre brought up. Through providing (and adhering) to such standards, M-PnP boosts scalability and reduces complexity within data center environments. At the same time, HPE is also working on a full OCP DC-MHS fam- ily of ProLiant Servers (in both 2U and 4U form factors) so that data center operators can integrate them directly into that overall architecture. Some of HPEs most interesting work in building DC-MHS modules comes in the area of DC Secure Control Modules (DC-SCMs). Here, the company is integrating its already well-known and award-winning Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) secure remote access, monitoring, and management into the OCP DC-MHS overall architecture. This prom- ises to make serious, hardware-level security part of what data center operators can take as given (and for granted). The modular approach that DC-SCM allows also lets HPE accelerate the cadence on its devel- opment cycle, and produce new security modules as and when theyre needed, instead of having to wait on CPU builds to release a new gen- eration of silicon on which a new security module can run. Why DC-MhS MatterS 20 HPE Modular Server benefits Greater operational flexibility lets enterprises and service provid- ers adapt faster and better to changing demands, workloads, and software stacks. Infrastructure can be right-sized to achieve tighter alignment between hardware capabilities and software stacks, for optimal performance and little or no wasted or excess capacity. HPEs commitment to OCP and DC-MHS means buyers can navigate Understanding Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) Capabilities HPE Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) is proprietary, hardware-based management technology designed to boost security and remote man- agement capabilities. It includes a Silicon Root of Trust, which safeguards servers against firmware attacks and unautho- rized access. iLO supports secure remote monitoring and management of server hardware, via an independent, self-powered module that remains remotely accessible even when a server is powered off. iLO further supports 2FA and encrypted communications protocols to establish and keep things secure. In addition to providing remote access to one server at a time, iLO also supports APIs for remote access, monitoring, and con- trol that work with HPEs OneView platform in the data center, and HPE GreenLake in the cloud for automation and site- or cloud-wide management. Learn more about how HPE iLO helps safeguard the entire server lifecycle. Why DC-MhS MatterS 21 a robust and active technology and partner ecosystem, with assured module interoperability and integration. Best of all, OCP and DC-MHS and their modular approach means modules may be swapped out and reused when and as theyre needed. This provides added value for investments in new technology, now and in the future. Tailored design for any workload comes from modular, open building blocks assembled to handle specific workloads. Servers open up and become vastly more configurable, where buyers can quickly and eas- ily adopt new technologies as they emerge. Consider what a modular server architecture does for the following Q&A: Want a faster CPU and more RAM? Upgrade the SC-HPM module (e.g., HPE M-DNO-4 for 1U/2U modules; HPE M-FLW for 4U). HPE M-DNO-4 (Adapted) HPE M-FLW OCP 3.0 NIC HPE DC-SCM M-CRPS PS HPE ProLiant Compute 1U HPE ProLiant Compute 2U HPE ProLiant Compute 4U FIGURE 6: Various HPM, optical networking, security, and power supply modules can be added or switched Why DC-MhS MatterS 22 Want denser, faster solid state storage? Upgrade one or more storage modules with newer NVMe drives and faster connections. Want faster optical networking? Upgrade one or more networking modules (e.g., OCP 3.0 NICs up to 400 Gbps). Want a better, more efficient power supply? Upgrade the M-CRPS PS to improve your power utilization and cooling costs. As things change, you should know what to do. Indeed, you should purchase only what you need to match your specific workloads. Then when the time is right you can swap or upgrade modules to meet changing demands, add capability or capacity, and more. HPEs vision for the various scenarios are shown in FIGURE 6.

In this chapter, youve learned the importance of the DC-MHS architecture in enabling flexible, parallel development for server components and how with this modular approach different hard - ware modules, such as CPU, RAM, storage, networking, and power supplies, can be developed and upgraded independently. Next, well look at how modular servers can be managed and operated using the OpenBMC capability that HPE ProLiant Servers support, which includes how HPE iLO improves and expands on those capabilities. 23 In the world of OCP data center servers, the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) manages the HPM module for remote access, boot-up and firmware checks, access control and data protection, and more. In general, the BMC also provides hardware health monitoring, handles firmware updates, and gener- ally keeps working even when the system is powered off. In a broad sense, a BMC does for the DC-MHS architecture what HPEs iLO (see previous chapter) has done for ProLiant Servers since it was intro- duced over 20 years ago. That said, OpenBMC does not replace iLO. HPE provides OpenBMC enablement on ProLiant servers. If an organization wishes to pursue an OpenBMC strategy on ProLiant servers, HPE enables this capabil- ity through HPE Transfer of Ownership. Nevertheless, HPE expects most buyers to opt for iLO as the path of greatest security for least overall cost. CHAPTER 3 OpenBMC and Modular Servers OPENBMC AND MODULAR SERVERS 24 Basics of OpenBMC OpenBMC is an open source firmware stack designed to run on DC-MHS baseboard management controllers (usually designated M-BMC in that nomenclature). Such controllers seek to enable and support simple, efficient server hardware management. The OpenBMC project originated with the Linux Foundation, and pro - vides a customizable platform for a familiar litany of tasksnamely remote monitoring, firmware updates, and system diagnostics. OpenBMC supports standards like Redfish for hardware manage - ment, and leverages the Yocto Project for building and distribution. OpenBMC is has been adopted in enterprise, high-performance com- puting (HPC), and cloud-scale data centers. Its designed to promote interoperability and flexibility in server management. For further information on OpenBMC, consult its Wikipedia article or its GitHub documentation. OpenBMC covers numerous technical management areas. These include the following: Monitoring and management (where applicable) of sensors and controls such as voltage and temperature in power supplies, and temperature sensors in all kinds of devices (e.g., CPU, storage devices, case interior, GPU, and so forth). Fan control: Managing cooling systems to establish and maintain optimal operating temperatures. Firmware updates: Enabling secure, remote updates for system firmware, including IAM, integrity checks, fallback restores, firmware updates, and more. System diagnostics: Monitoring system health and diagnosing potential issues. Security management: Using interfaces like Redfish for secure communications and management. OPENBMC AND MODULAR SERVERS 25 Event logging: Capturing and analyzing system events for troubleshooting, anomaly detection, and auditing. An OpenBMC strategy gives the customer total ownership of their BMC firmware, and confers to them the responsibility to design and maintain the features needed for their specific data center environ- ment. Here again, iLO checks all the same boxes and supports the same APIs as does OpenBMC. Key OpenBMC Features In data center (and other) environments OpenBMC provides the basis for flexibility and added customization, including APIs for remote access, data collection, automation, and control. It offers enhanced security, to make sure that servers under its purview can only be accessed with appropriate credentials and controls, and that updates will be properly and securely performed only by authorized parties. Its designed to make data centers more manageable and reliable, and to do so cost-effectively without requiring swivel-chair integration across a collection of otherwise unrelated point solutions or individ- ual consoles or control panels. How HPEs Modular Servers Play into OCP and OpenBMC HPEs modular ProLiant Servers are designed to align with OCP DC-MHS modular systems, and with relevant standards and requirements. These modular servers thus can optionally support OpenBMC, as an alternative to HPEs iLO technology. In general, HPEs ability to work through iLO on a server at a time basis, but also through HPE OpenView at the data center level, and through HPE GreenLake across private and public clouds provide ample scalability, OPENBMC AND MODULAR SERVERS 26 flexibility, automation, and control.

In this chapter, youve learned more about how modular servers may be managed and operated, using the OpenBMC option that HPE ProLiant servers support. Youve also learned how HPE iLO improves and expands on those capabilities. In the next and final chapter, well explore how a major global service provider makes use of OCP DC-MHS in its operations, and how HPE modular servers are helping them succeed and thrive. 27 phoenixNAP is a global IT service provider that focuses on Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and other enterprise-grade IT technologies and services. A key goal is to commoditize its modular server offerings as part of this portfolio, and make them available to organizations of various sizes. Among the companys broad collection of offerings, youll find: Servers: Dedicated servers are available to organizations that require single-tenant operations with all the options, flexibility, and scalability of the cloud. Cloud: Customers can choose among a variety of cloud types, including managed private cloud, data security cloud, hybrid cloud, and more. Backup and restore: Access to various backup and recovery options and services, including disaster recovery, multiple backup and recovery platforms, and more. Security: Data security cloud, encryption management platforms, confidential computing services, ransomware protection, and DDOS protection. CHAPTER 4 Casing A Service Provider: phoenixNAP CASING A SERVICE PROVIDER: PHOENIxNAP 28 Networking services: Geolocation, content delivery networks, load balancing, routing optimization, QoS, DNS optimization, and more. In its explicit goal to commoditize cloud-based as-a-service offer- ings of all kinds, phoenixNAP has been an active and vocal supporter of OCP and DC-MHS since the projects inception in 2022. It advo- cates for, and uses, DC-MHS-compliant servers. phoenixNAP has also worked with various vendors that include Micron, Intel, AMD, Dell, and HPE 4 to promote and obtain DC-MHS compliant servers and modules. Above all, phoenixNAP seeks to speed upgrades to new server and technology generations, to streamline deployment, and to let cus - tomers get right to work using its unique approach. Simply put: cus- tomers need only log into the phoenixNAP platform. They can begin to use a dedicated server in less than two minutes, and pay only for the resources they consume. phoenixNAP seeks to be first to market with technologies the com- pany believes inespecially OCP DC-MHSmade quickly and readily available to customers through a simple, direct consumption-based model using the latest technologies with the best value. Upgrades and migrations are designed to be simple, easy, and fast. Ideally, migra- tions involve little more than changing a set of data pointers from an old virtual infrastructure into a new one. Finally, phoenixNAP uses modular servers to meet speed and agility demands of cloud-native, on-premises, and SaaS development cus- tomers across multiple markets. That includes advertising technol- ogy (AdTech), financial technology (FinTech), and state, local, and education (SLED) sectors. Indeed, phoenixNAP has switched from monolithic servers to modular, scalable, pluggable designs in its 18 global data centers to expand all of its multi-tenant facilities. 4 Martin Wielomski (VP of Products, phoenixNAP), phoenixNAP Becomes the First in the World to Deploy a High-Performance, Power-Efficient Solution for Cloud-Native, Scale- Out Compute Workloads, November 2024 CASING A SERVICE PROVIDER: PHOENIxNAP 29 Modular Building Blocks Empower Expanding Services and Consumption Models Indeed, phoenixNAP was HPEs first customer for DC-MHS modular servers. From the get-go, the impetus was to deploy reusable build- ing blocks for multiple designs across multiple markets and business models. HPEs disaggregated servers make data centers interopera- ble and compatible, thanks to consistent interfaces and form factors explicitly engineered for security from silicon all the way through to software. A key principle is that phoenixNAPs IaaS platform speeds product introductions, by obviating ground-up custom designs, and reduced TCO from modular innovations and sourcing across the entire HPE partner ecosystem. Mr. Peter Groth, HPE VP, GM, and CTO for Service Providers, says of this effort: Service providers are investing in next-generation infrastructure to address evolving enterprise IT requirements across new workload demands, heightened security concerns, and flexibility needs as businesses scale or change.

In short, HPEs new modular DC-MHS servers are powering delivery of high-performance, always-available infrastruc- ture that work with cloud-like ease and simplicity, to bring apps and workloads closer to DevSecOps teams and users alike. CASING A SERVICE PROVIDER: PHOENIxNAP 30 Modular Server Futures Explored and Explained As HPE continues to develop its modular server platforms, it looks to go beyond electrical interfaces and signaling commonality like those currently defined in OCP DC-MHS specifications, to enabling real plug and play within modular server-based data centers. To that end, the company is driving the development of OCP DC-MHS M-PnP technologies and standards. In the Windows world, PnP provides reasonable expectations that compatible devices may be plugged into a suitable connection and just work. For DC-MHS servers, M-PnP envisions a suitably engi- neered runtime environment where compatible modules get plugged in, get discovered, and (where necessary) properly configured by some kind of BMC or related agent, and do the very same thingthat is, they just work. This could enable truly mix-and-match server configuration, where any combination of the right modules could be relied upon to come together and act like a complete data center server. This would allow organizations to put modules together as needed to handle work- loads. But it would also allow organizations to upgrade modules without replacing servers outright. This would be especially useful for independent upgrades to CPU and memory modules, security modules, storage modules, networking connections, and more effi- cient power supplies. With that kind of reusability, sustainability, and energy efficiency, it opens new and better ways to build and operate data centers, and the servers that make them run. CASING A SERVICE PROVIDER: PHOENIxNAP 31 Advancing at Full Speed Modular servers decouple the development of server modules for security, storage, networking, and so forth, from dependence and timing of upstream CPU vendors. This allows new technologies to advance at full speed, with the ability to replace older modules with newer ones as available and support for flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. This is especially important for security, storage, and net- working, which typically advance on a more rapid cadence than CPUs. 32 ABOUT HPE HPE is the global edge-to-cloud company built to transform your business.

HPE offers a range of NVIDIA GPUs designed to power various workloads, from AI and deep learning to professional visualization. Our offerings span from the entry-level A2 to the high performance H200 NVL, designed for large-scale AI inferencing and high performance computing (HPC). With this comprehensive lineup, we help ensure businesses and developers have the right GPU solution to meet their specific performance and scalability needs. HPE water cooling options HPE future-focused cooling strategy supports the ever-growing processing power needs of todays businesses and advances sustainability. Businesses adopt larger IT systems to analyze increasing data volumes as well as support AI workloads. However, these systems strain air-cooling setups in data centers, impacting overall efficiency. Heat from powerful CPUs and GPUs, soon to draw over 500 watts, worsens the cooling crisis. 3D silicon chips exacerbate the issue, as traditional cooling can struggle to cool the entire chip stack effectively, risking overheating in lower layers. HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 rack and tower servers | 14 As businesses search for holistic solutions that closely match their performance, energy efficiency, and sustainability initiatives, HPE offers three cooling options for select HPE systemsclosed-loop liquid cooling, DLC, and liquid-to-air cooling. Closed-loop liquid cooling functions like a server-contained radiator akin to a cars engine cooling system. Completely integrated into the computers chassis, cool liquid is piped to cold plates atop CPUs and draws off heat. The warm liquid flows through a heat exchanger that is cooled by air in motion. Once cooled, it returns to the cold plates. DLC improves power usage effectiveness (PUE) and cuts cooling expenses in a fully rack- contained and integrated water-cooled system. Our DLC unit directs coolant through cold plates atop CPUs, capturing heat and pumping it elsewhere for cooling. HPE offers systems that are fully liquid cooled and others where most of the server heat goes to water (DLC) and the rest of the server heat goes to air through fans. Liquid-to-air cooling solutions refer to a cooling system where liquid is used to absorb heat from a device or system and then the heat is transferred from the liquid to the air. HPE offers two liquid-to-air cooling solutionsHPE Rear Door Heat Exchanger or HPE Adaptive Rack Cooling Solution. These work with facility-chilled water that provides cold air where it is needed most in the rack.

    "text": "Modern infrastructure, modern protection: server security for whats next Build a secure future with infrastructure prepared from the silicon up Solution brief Modern infrastructure, modern protection: server security for whats next | 2 Risks of aging infrastructure Silent gaps that legacy infrastructure may miss: Firmware drift between updates Unvalidated third-party components Rootkit behavior at the silicon level Offline configuration changes Credential tampering during downtime HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 with HPE iLO 7 helps close these gaps with out-of-band visibilityeven when the OS is offline. Just as your organization strives to innovate and grow, so does the threat landscape. HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 servers with HPE iLO 7 help you outsmart evolving risks so you can stay focused on what matters. The case for modern server security Todays threat landscape wears more disguises. Those threats can come from unexpected angles with tactics that are harder to spotlet alone stopwith attacks increasingly targeting firmware and supply chains. Secure infrastructure means protecting every layer at every moment of its lifecycle, while keeping up with compliance demands and operational complexity. But traditional defenses like firewalls and endpoint tools werent designed to address what happens before the OS boots or when servers sit idle. And its increasingly unrealistic for manual security processes such as patching, updates, and configuration management to keep up with the speed and scale of modern operations. The result? Gaps that quietly grow across hybrid and multi-gen environments. IT decision-makers are confronted with a variety of questions: How do you secure what isnt always visible? Whats the long-term cost of drifting out of compliance? How do you modernize infrastructure without adding new risk or burden? The first step is moving from layered security to embedded protectionbuilt into the platform, future-ready, and active from day one. Take control with a platform built for security at every layer Keeping infrastructure secure gets harder as environments expand across sites, workloads, and deployment models. HPEs leadership in server security is built on decades of innovationfrom silicon root of trust to secure boot to complete lifecycle protection. Advanced features that expand platform protection: Secure enclave architecture for encryption key isolation Real-time dashboards for threat detection Configuration locks and TLS-only encryption Machine-specific firmware verification Active security even when the server is powered off These capabilities deliver built-in intelligence that starts protecting before the OS even boots. With HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12, that foundation gets even stronger. HPE iLO 7 represents the next step in this evolution, giving IT teams powerful, built-in tools to detect threats early, enforce policies consistently, and respond quickly when something goes wrong. Rather than layering security on top of the stack, HPE integrates it at every level. HPE iLO 7 runs on its own isolated silicon and remains active even when the host OS is down, giving teams continuous insight into server health, integrity, and exposure. The new secure enclave architecture stores credentials safely and helps prevent tampering. Meanwhile, real-time dashboards, machine-specific firmware updates, and configuration locks make secure operations easier to maintain at scale. By bringing together hardware, firmware, and management in one resilient platform, you can modernize with confidence, knowing security is already built in and ready to support you from day one. A simple path to strong protection Upgrading infrastructure often comes with concerns about disruption, inconsistency, or management overhead. But HPE iLO 7 is designed to ease that transition, making secure operations easier to maintain across mixed environments. With its real-time dashboards, machine-specific firmware validation, and centralized credential control, HPE iLO 7 gives IT teams greater confidence that policies are enforced and threats are visible, no matter how fast the environment grows. Whether youre adding new servers or refreshing in stages, HPE iLO 7 helps you maintain and strengthen your security with deeper visibility and tighter control.

Modernize now with HPE ProLiant Compute solutions for better performance, efficiencies, and security. Solution brief 1 AI power: Expanding data center capacity to meet growing demand, McKinsey & Co., Oct. 29, 2024. 2 60 world records for performance and efficiency with HPE ProLiant, HPE, 2024. 3 HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen11 vs. Gen12 ComparisonWhats the Difference? server-parts.eu, Feb. 15, 2025. Dont let aging servers stall enterprise innovation | 2 While technology continues to advance at a dizzying pace, one fact remains unchanged: Organizations that innovate faster and more efficiently than their competition are the ones that will prevail. But achieving high levels of innovation sometimes requires business leaders to break with tradition and make bold choices. At the same time, demands on IT have never been greater. Tech teams are being asked to meet ever-increasing computing needs of the AI-driven enterprise while also supporting non-AI workloads; at higher performance, accelerated pace comprises most day-to-day digital operations. And theyre expected to fulfill the current or projected needs in the most cost-efficient way possiblewhile also meeting organizational sustainability goals. Achieving these outcomes requires an approach that focuses on rapid infrastructure modernization. While traditional hardware refresh cycles of three to five years have served enterprises well for decades, were now in an era in which the benefits of more frequent modernization efforts significantly outweigh the costs. Simply put, older, multigenerational servers struggle to handle the performance demands of modern workloads. Plus, these aging systems are likely harder to manage and more costly to operate; theyre also less energy efficient and lack the future-ready security features delivered by the latest HPE ProLiant Gen11 and HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 servers. Yes, your aging infrastructure may still be operational, but for how long and at what additional impact to your bottom line? Accelerating your refresh cycle can keep you from falling behind in areas most crucial to the success of your enterprise. Greater performance for demanding workloads and AIdriven use cases While performance has always been the primary consideration for choosing servers, it takes on increased importance in an era where outstanding execution delivers faster, better results. Its estimated that by 2030, the demand for data center capacity is likely to increase by up to 27%, with AI workloads accounting for roughly a third of that total. 1 Additionally, with the continued demand for VDI and the emergence of AI workloadsand the need for inference at the edgeperformance speed has never been more important. The HPE ProLiant Gen11 server achieved 60 records for performance against industry-recognized benchmarks, including three for compute-intensive workloads. 2 Holding multiple world records in AI inferencing benchmarks, The HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 is even more powerful, delivering lower latency communications, 3 and featuring the Intel Xeon 6 processor with nearly 2.5 times as many cores per CPU as Gen11. The HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12with support for more GPUsis truly a great choice to power a variety of AI workloads. 4 New Technology: The Projected Total Economic Impact of HPE Compute Ops Management, Forrester Research, June 2024. 5 Q1 2025 Global Cyber Attack Report from Check Point Software: An Almost 50% Surge in Cyber Threats Worldwide, with a Rise of 126% in Ransomware Attacks, Check Point Research, April 16, 2025. 6 Currently pursuing certification for FIPS 140-3 Level 3. 7 AI to drive 165% increase in data center power demand by 2030, Goldman Sachs, Feb. 4, 2025.

Full asset lifecycle sustainability, from design to packaging and IT asset disposition, also figure heavily in product favorability. In many industry sectors, IT expenditures can claim a large investment. In these same sectors, IT infrastructure such as compute, storage, and network resources can be a large source of carbon emissions. Against this backdrop, recent Enterprise Strategy Group research found that 56% of organizations surveyed reported that IT was a leader in driving sustainability initiatives in their firms, followed by executive functions (39%) and dedicated environmental, social, and governance executive teams (32%). Clearly, achieving sustainability goals is a key initiative for most major organizations, and IT technology and operations should be considered one of the most straightforward paths to achieve that result. Executive commitment to sustainability creates strategic alignment between IT and the business, with executive support making the transitions easier. It also raises the profile of sustainability initiatives in IT.

When considering consolidation, its important to consider that: HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 servers deliver a considerable performance advantage over previous generations. 3 Technical First Look: The Sustainability Impact of HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 Servers Older server generations like Gen8 and Gen9 are reaching end of life and are no longer receiving security updates, exposing customers to potential risks. HPE has a substantial install base of millions of Gen10 servers that could benefit from upgrading. The new Gen12 processors include security features to protect against quantum computing threats. As quantum computing technology develops, these protections will be a requirement. Power and Performance Efficiency To validate the power-performance efficiency of HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 servers, we examined the results of testing published by the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). SPEC is a performance standardization body with more than 60 member companies that produces realistic, standardized performance tests across numerous system performance disciplines. When looking at maximal consolidation opportunities based on performance and power efficiency, we compared results published for Gen8, Gen9, Gen10 (Plus), and Gen12 ProLiant servers. Results were obtained using the SPECrate2017_int_base suite from the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark. The HPE Power Advisor tool was used to calculate the consolidation ratio and savings when upgrading HPE ProLiant Compute previous-generation servers with Gen12 servers. The SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark measures compute-intensive performance, stressing a systems processor, memory subsystem, and compiler. As shown in Figure 2, organizations with populations of previous-generation servers still in service can consolidate their server footprint by up to 26x, while cutting power and cooling costs by up to 87%, by switching to Gen12 servers. Figure 2. Consolidating With HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 Servers Source: HPE and Enterprise Strategy Group, a division of TechTarget, Inc. 4 Technical First Look: The Sustainability Impact of HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 Servers As shown in Table 1, the total compute performance measured for HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 servers ranged from more than 6x that of HPE ProLiant Compute Gen10 Plus servers to more than 26x that of HPE ProLiant Compute Gen8 servers. We rounded the number of consolidated servers down to ensure servers would not be oversubscribed in our model. Power efficiency was calculated by comparing the total thermal design power (TDP) requirements for the consolidated servers to a single Gen12 server. Power savings ranged from 66.7% to 86.9%. In Figure 2, savings percentages were rounded normally. Table 1. Performance and Power Data Generation TDP (Watts) SPECrate2017_int_base Consolidation Ratio Power Savings With Gen12 Gen8 95 37.5 26 86.9% Gen9 85 66.9 14 72.3% Gen10 185 139 7 74.5% Gen10 Plus 165 154 6 66.7% Gen12 330 996 n/a n/a Source: HPE and Enterprise Strategy Group, a division of TechTarget, Inc.

Workload matching: A standard feature of HPE ProLiant, workload matching encapsulates decades of HPE performance engineering expertise into preconfigured, user-selectable profiles that automatically optimize hundreds of BIOS setting combinations to precisely match server resources to workload requirements. Workload matching helps eliminate the trial-and-error and risk of server tuning, delivering the performance and efficiency of a server ideally suited to its workload tasks.

HPE Right Mix Advisor: Built on the experience of over a thousand hybrid cloud engagements, HPE Right Mix Advisor delivers data-driven guidance to quickly and confidently move workloads to the right mix of hybrid cloud platforms, helping to optimize performance for business-specific needs and reduce costs. Trusted security by design From silicon to software, from factory to cloud, and from generation to generation, HPE ProLiant is engineered with a fundamental security approach to defend against increasingly complex threats through an uncompromising focus to deliver constant security advancements thats built into our DNA. Protect your infrastructure, workloads, and data from threats to hardware, and risks from third-party software, with a trusted edge-to-cloud security posture built on an HPE compute core hardened through a proven, zero trust approach to security. HPE ProLiant provides an enhanced holistic, 360-degree view to security that begins in the manufacturing supply chain and concludes with a safeguarded, end-of-life decommissioning. Secure supply chain: HPE ProLiant security begins with the corruption-free manufacture of the server, auditing the integrity of every component hardware and firmware providing an assurance that the server begins its lifecycle uncompromised. Silicon root of trust: It anchors the essential firmware of HPE ProLiant to an ASIC even before the server is built, creating an immutable fingerprint that must be exactly matched before the server will boot. This helps ensure malicious code is contained and healthy servers are protected. Server configuration lock: Secured by a customer-supplied password, server configuration lock creates a digital fingerprint of the server configuration, preventing it from booting should there be an unauthorized configuration change or tampering detected. Security dashboard: A single interface to display the overall server security status, the current configuration for the security state, and server configuration lock plus the status of numerous security features, the security dashboard also provides access to change security alerts and manage settings. Production to CNSA security modes: Equipped with HPE iLO, HPE ProLiant provides four security modes production, high security, FIPS 140-2, and Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) (the highest-level cryptographic algorithm available for commercial systems). Server system restore: Should a server be compromised, the fastest path to bring it back online and into normal operations again is with HPE server system restore, a feature of HPE iLO. Server system automated recovery includes restoration of validated firmware, facilitated recovery of the operating system, application, and data connections. One button secure erase: When its time to retire or repurpose an HPE ProLiant server, one button secure erase speeds and simplifies the complete removal of passwords, configuration settings, and data, preventing inadvertent access to previously secured information.

Solution HPE ProLiant DL320 Gen12 SP Servers HPE iLO HPE Compute While growth is the main goal of many businesses, scale comes at a price. Increased costs and management complexity can put the brakes on expansion. To tackle these challenges, organizations constantly strive to find ways to maximize performance while staying on budget and keeping their IT infrastructure easily manageable. Striking this balance was a challenge for phoenixNAP, a global IT service provider focused on continually expanding its footprint and perfecting its diverse infrastructure as a service portfolio. Originally established as a network access point (NAP) in Phoenix, Arizona, phoenixNAP has evolved into a full-service data center and one of the main network hubs of the U.S. Southwest. Today, we support a range of clients from SMBs to enterprises across 18 global data centers and network point of presence (PoP). Our flagship product, Bare Metal Cloud, offers businesses the ability to deploy and manage high performance physical servers with cloud-like ease and simplicity. Part of our success comes from our ability to keep pace with our customers evolving requirements and needs. For example, weve automated deployments and introduced edge-to-cloud computing to our product portfolio. Weve also seen that AI is transforming how clients consume data center resources. This pushed us to optimize our server portfolio to better accommodate modern, data-intensive workloads such as AI training and inferencing or high performance computing (HPC). To meet evolving market demands and empower clients with comprehensive IT infrastructure solutions, partnering with reliable, innovative hardware vendors is essential. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is one of our key partners, helping us deliver automated, dedicated infrastructure solutionsnot only to our clients but also to our internal teams handling updates, storage and compute configurations, and server troubleshooting. At the end of the day, the more we automate everything, the more room we have for strategic planning and adding value to our products. Martin Wielomski, VP of Products, phoenixNAP phoenixNAP becomes the first in the world to deploy a high performance, power-efficient solution for cloud-native, scale-out compute workloads | 2 Recognizing the importance of infrastructure modernization As VP of products at phoenixNAP, I spearhead product innovation from our Amsterdam office. I oversee the evolution of our infrastructure and automated provisioning platform, ensuring we deliver market-leading IT solutions that empower clients worldwide. We take pride in our solution enabling clients to automatically provision and manage bare metal servers in minutes through API, CLI, or WebUI. However, our excellent partnership with HPE helped us continue to be one of the first to deliver as-a-service access to next-gen server technologies. We were already using HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers with 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors. We were also offering Arm-based server instances powered by HPE ProLiant RL300 Gen11 servers, which helped us venture outside the x86 ecosystem. In short, I already knew that HPE had a future-forward mindset that could help us further update our infrastructure to provide the processing power and energy efficiency our clients demand. I was looking forward to gaining access to their cutting-edge hardware and offering it to clients who demand maximum performance and optimal power management for their cloud-native workloads. As it turned out, HPE was preparing to release its Gen12 servers featuring the latest, Intel Xeon 6 processors. These new chips boasted significant gen-on-gen performance gains and offered advanced power management features that substantially reduce energy consumption. As such, they were the perfect mix of increased CPU core count and throughput our clients required. We wanted a modular, open approach at the hardware layer to increase core density, reduce workload costs, and simplify our infrastructure operations across our fleet. Confident in HPEs capabilities, we were the first customer in the world to order HPE ProLiant DL320 Gen12 SP servers, and the benefits of the upgrade were immediate. Increased automation for easier maintenance We aim to avoid having dozens of IT team members spending endless hours installing updates, deploying servers, and managing infrastructure. The new HPE servers allowed us to further enhance our automation-driven operations. With HPE ProLiant servers, a single engineer can handle everything with a few clicks and this seamlessly aligns with our existing workflows. Using HPE iLO, my team can remotely manage our HPE ProLiant servers anywhere in the world. I can limit access to a select group of IT administrators who can connect to servers across our global network instead of going on-site to troubleshoot or plug in an Ethernet cable. Our infrastructure is their infrastructure, and we want our clients to feel confident that we can scale to accommodate their business as they expand.

After all, our infrastructure is their infrastructure, and we want our clients to feel confident that we can accommodate their business as they expand. Supporting an influx of AI infrastructure Partnering with HPE enabled phoenixNAP to expand our business and make tomorrows technology available to anyone while continuing to support our enterprise SaaS, FinTech, AdTech, and SLED clients. These companies are likely to embrace AI in the coming years through small- to mid-size retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologyif they havent already. This technology will enhance the accuracy and reliability of their models with external data, and we will be able to support their data processing needs with our new HPE ProLiant DL320 Gen12 SP servers with Intel Xeon 6 technology. Our next step is to install additional HPE ProLiant servers featuring Intel Xeon 6 CPUs at our data centers. These units will provide additional capacity while being customized and validated for servers using NVIDIA GPUs, the industry standard for AI applications. Using HPE technology, we are currently meeting 7080% of our customers processing needs. Once these new servers are deployed, we will be able to handle even more. A future that enables doing more and being better HPE backs its products with outstanding support, and its engineers are highly responsive. The human factor played a big part in our decision to complement our infrastructure offering with HPE ProLiant Gen12 servers. If were having trouble with an automated workflow or a server starts acting up, we can reach out to HPE and usually get an answer within hours. Even when dealing with something more complex, HPE never fails to find a solution. That said, HPE hardware isnt just about doing more; its about being better.

Do you need security built into everything? We can help you to adopt a zero trust framework so that you can close gaps and reduce complexity. That's built-in security, wisely done. How security is evolving as companies adopt hybrid cloud Which cloud solutions do users think are best for security? Our survey might surprise you. Learn why customized security strategies are crucial for your organization's protection. Meet the right security standards The lifeblood of your business is the data you generate, transform, store, and move. Take a silicon-to-cloud approach to securing your data infrastructure spanning clouds, data centers, and edges while also helping to protect against ransomware attacks. Ponemon Institute: Security strategies to close security gaps and protect valuable data in the AI era The increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and the accelerating adoption of AI make it more important than ever to become aggressive in closing security gaps in IT infrastructure. The 2025 Ponemon Institute study discusses security strategies that high-performing teams use to reduce risk in an edge-to-cloud world.

It’s like giving your infrastructure the ability to think, learn, and act—so your teams can move faster, reduce risk, and unlock more value from your data. Antonio Neri announces GreenLake Intelligence at HPE Discover 2025 A short demonstration of GreenLake Intelligence Deep intelligence where it matters AI agents trained to understand enterprise IT from workloads to infrastructure and act on your intent. Break down the silos Agents solve problems across layers and domains, working together with continuity and context. Bring the opportunities to you Always-on, proactive recommendations enable intelligent optimization. Action, not just answers Eliminate manual tasks with autonomous IT. Agents take action, subject to your approval. What collective intelligence looks like Multiple, domain-specific LLMs trained on HPE data to form an agentic mesh capable of learning and acting to automate processes, workflows, and prevent IT problems before they occur—across clouds, domains, tools, and tasks. GreenLake Intelligence in action Take a look at these example use cases we are enabling with GreenLake Intelligence to get a feel for how multi-domain agentic AI can accelerate your IT. Diagnosing an app performance issue Workload optimization and orchestration Proactive issue resolution Onboarding a new device You have purchased a new network switch and need to onboard it to your GreenLake workspace. Instead of clicking through the user interface for adding a device, which involves several screens, you ask the assistant to add a device for you. It prompts you to provide the serial number and MAC address of the device, then determines the appropriate subscription and management service to attach to it. You simply view and approve a summary of what will be done to add the device, and AI agents do the rest. The mesh is open to more stitches GreenLake Intelligence is compliant with standard AI protocols such as Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling you to connect it with other agents and devices. Your ITSM system could collaborate with GreenLake to fully automate the implementation of tickets. You could bring your third-party infrastructure under GreenLake management. In other words, our agentic mesh is open to more stitches. And the work is not all on your shoulders: HPE plans to work with its ecosystem of technology partners to create specific agentic integrations. HPE channel partners benefit too For HPE channel partners, GreenLake Intelligence unlocks many new opportunities for value creation.

    "text": "Customer story\nAchieving peak  \nindustrial efficiency  \nwith predictive  \nmaintenance\nBosch Digital Twin Industries is transforming machinery performance with \nan integrated asset management solution powered by edge AI\nBosch Digital Twin-IAPM solution drives significant improvements in industrial equipment operations by minimizing \ndowntime, reducing maintenance costs, and cutting energy consumption. Powered by edge AI, this technology \npredicts equipment failures, resulting in improved operational efficiency, increased business margins, and greater \nenvironmental sustainability.Customer: Bosch Digital Twin Industries\nIndustry: Manufacturing\nCountry: Germany\n\n\n“ Imagine a machine that tells you what \nspare parts it will need in the next 30 or \n60 days — and interacts with you almost \nlike a human would. That’s exactly what we \nmake possible with our solution.”Outcomes\n —Reduces unplanned downtime \nand maintenance costs by \nenabling predictive maintenance\n —Increases operational efficiencies \nwith real-time edge insights, \neasing team workloads\n —Optimizes resource use, reduces \nenergy consumption, and extends \nasset lifespanVision\nTransform industries by providing \nsolutions that optimize asset \nperformance, enable planned \ndowntime, and support \nsustainable operations\nStrategy\nBuild an integrated asset \nperformance management solution \nwith real-time edge AI to enhance \noperational efficiency and reliabilityPowering modern society through \ninnovative products\nFounded as the Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical \nEngineering, Bosch has consistently led with innovation. Today, the \ncompany is a world leader in building the machines and engines \nthat power modern society and enhance everyday life, and it is \ncommitted to reducing complexity and conserving resources. “We’re motivated by the desire to develop sustainable products \nthat are invented for life — that spark enthusiasm, that improve \nquality of life, and that help conserve natural resources,” says \nPrahallad CR, head of technology & innovation at Bosch Digital \nTwin Industries. “The point is always to take away complexity and \nmake people’s jobs easier.”\nIt was this motivation that led Bosch Digital Twin Industries to \nrecently develop a groundbreaking digital twin-in-a-box on \nintegrated asset performance management (IAPM) solution. This \ntool enables organizations to create dynamic software models — or \ntwins — of their physical industrial assets and continuously monitor \nthem by using the combined advantages of edge and cloud. With edge AI-enhanced insights, users can predict failures, \nsimulate scenarios, and make data-driven decisions, leading to \nreduced downtime, optimized energy use, and increased asset \nlifespan along with cost savings. Keeping large industrial assets running with maximum efficiency\nBosch Digital Twin Industries’ focus on innovation and value creation has intensified as sectors embrace automation \nand digitization. Recognizing the challenges its energy production, utilities, and industrial manufacturing customers were facing \nin predicting and preventing unplanned maintenance, the company identified the need for an advanced asset \nmanagement solution. As their machinery grew more complex, these customers were struggling to prevent surprise \nbreakdowns and unexpected downtime in their large industrial assets — such as mining conveyors and chemical \nreactors, wind power parks, energy grids, and more. That meant they were losing valuable time, money, and resources. Organizations also lacked the tools to identify \ninefficiencies and respond quickly to problems, risking costly disruptions along with negative impacts on overall \nproductivity and profitability. In heavy industries such as steel, asset failures can likewise pose serious safety risks \nto employees. In response, Bosch Digital Twin Industries developed a digital twin-integrated IAPM solution specifically designed to \noptimize the operations of large industrial assets and prevent such risks. “Imagine a machine that tells you what spare parts it will need in the next 30 or 60 days — and interacts with you \nalmost like a human would.

In heavy industries such as steel, asset failures can likewise pose serious safety risks \nto employees. In response, Bosch Digital Twin Industries developed a digital twin-integrated IAPM solution specifically designed to \noptimize the operations of large industrial assets and prevent such risks. “Imagine a machine that tells you what spare parts it will need in the next 30 or 60 days — and interacts with you \nalmost like a human would. That’s exactly what we make possible with our solution,” says Prahallad. “We wanted to help – Prahallad CR , Head of Technology & Innovation, Bosch Digital Twin Industries\nAchieving peak industrial efficiency with predictive maintenance | 2\n\norganizations overcome operational bottlenecks and \nlimitations, enable robust operational continuity, and \nunlock the full potential of their machinery and equipment.”\nReal-time insights and seamless \noperation\nBosch Digital Twin Industries has advanced the real-time \ndata processing and analytics capabilities of its IAPM \nsolution by integrating edge AI, enabling immediate \nresponses without the latency of cloud processing. The addition of an edge server and reduced reliance on \ncloud connectivity has enhanced the twin-in-a-box’s \nability to operate anywhere, making it highly beneficial \nfor industries managing distributed assets in remote \nor low-connectivity areas. This approach is particularly \nimportant for critical infrastructure customers who are \nrestricted from moving to the cloud. By reducing reliance on cloud connectivity, organizations \ncan also scale more easily by lowering infrastructure and \nbandwidth requirements. This helps avoid the high costs \ntypically associated with scaling cloud services. Bosch Digital Twin Industries chose HPE ProLiant DL380 \nGen11 Servers in a ruggedized enclosure with HPE Ezmeral \nUnified Analytics Software to power its solution. “The way I think of it, HPE is building the road, and we \nare creating the vehicles that drive on it — where the \nvehicles are our digital twin software. By joining forces \nwith HPE, our solution can deliver predictive intelligence \nvia reliable edge AI capabilities that seamlessly connect \nenvironments,” says Prahallad. Bosch Digital Twin Industries also integrated HPE Aruba \nNetworking solutions for added flexibility. This gives \norganizations the freedom to choose between an \nedge -wired solution or a ruggedized, secure wireless \nsolution when they install the twin-in-a-box. “HPE helped us to radically simplify deployment methods \nfor our solution,” shares Prahallad. “Without these, it \nwould be much more difficult for our customers to \nquickly adopt our solution at scale.”\nEnhancing reliability and enabling \npredictive maintenance\nWith its IAPM solution in place, Bosch Digital Twin \nIndustries is significantly enhancing its customers’ ability \nto monitor and optimize their industrial processes.

Outcomes\n• Establishes self-service functionality \nfor customers\n• Reduces provisioning times from \nweeks to days\n• Optimizes energy costs through \nsmarter infrastructure utilityHPE DIGITAL GAME CHANGERS\nSelf-service drives \nclients’ transformation \nplans \nAutomation accelerates COMLINE’s IT service \ndelivery, setting new standards in business agility \nThe last two years have demonstrated to businesses the \nimportance of moving quickly on IT transformation projects. For IT service providers the challenge is enabling clients \nto access the services they need, quickly and efficiently. This means relentless automation while enabling clients to \nself-serve. Delivering business advantage through IT innovation\nDisruption caused by the COVID pandemic has meant a busy two years for the \nGerman IT service provider, COMLINE. Clients have been forced to bring forward \ntheir transformation plans and quickly adapt to the new circumstances. Proven IT \nexpertise is at a premium. “We’re not one of the industry giants; we’re the hidden champion from Hamburg,” \nsays COMLINE COO, Ralf Schäfer. “But we grew 15% in services last year, twice as \nfast as the market.”\nRevenues for 2020 were $90M. COMLINE is targeting $130M by 2025. “Growth will come,” Schäfer says, “through more customers realizing the fundamental \npotential of IT to transform their business. Customers of all sizes—not just enterprise \nclass, want to learn more about service process automation, IoT, software development, \nor cloud delivery models. We see an opportunity to act as consultants, advising on \nScrum methodology and agile working to build new digital products and services. We \ncan help customers create new competitive advantages through IT innovation.” \nCOMLINE wants its client-facing teams to become more entrepreneurial. It also \nwants to streamline its IT infrastructure to create a more dynamic, scalable platform \nto grow. As part of this, COMLINE wants to migrate services out of its data centers \ninto a new private cloud. This will build flexibility, scale, and commercial control while \nenabling German data to stay in Germany. “This will fulfill the strategy that we’ve been pursuing for years,” says Schäfer, “offering \ncustomers a real cloud experience from German data centers at competitive prices.”\n\nHPE DIGITAL GAME CHANGERS\nCreating a breathing data center\nCOMLINE will migrate its outsourcing data centers in Frankfurt \nand Berlin to the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. This \nwill fundamentally transform how the business engages with \nclients, says Stojan Jarak, COMLINE’s business unit director, \n“creating a breathing data center.” It includes a 40% capacity \nbuffer to accommodate spikes in demand. The migration is made while maintaining COMLINE’s \ncontinuity with the HPE ProLiant family of servers. The new \nHPE GreenLake private cloud is built on HPE ProLiant DL380 \nservers. The use of HPE StoreOnce then establishes efficient \nstorage management. In tandem, these deliver performance \nand scalability with secure, simple to manage storage. Jarak says the upgrade is in line with COMLINE’s commitment \nto achieve maximum performance out of its IT infrastructure. “HPE GreenLake is more than a list of components; it is the big \npicture,” he explains. “It allows us to abstract the hardware and \npivot to a service-oriented approach. We have more than 20 years’ \nexperience of working with the HPE, and an affinity to ProLiant \nservers. The move to HPE GreenLake was a natural step.”\nWe see an opportunity to act as \nconsultants, advising on Scrum \nmethodology and agile working \nto build new digital products and \nservices.

COMLINE \nanticipates the buffer being in regular use, as it conducts \nproofs of concept with customers or tests new environments. The engagement with HPE allows COMLINE to then reassess \nbaseline capacity, with a fast track to additional resources. “With HPE GreenLake, we can increase and decrease our \ncapacities just like changing the volume on a sound system,” \nadds Schäfer. HPE DIGITAL GAME CHANGERS\nFocusing on service \ninnovation \nThe engagement promises to transform \nthe speed and delivery of COMLINE’s \nservices. The HPE GreenLake platform \nwill form the basis of a more flexible, \ndynamic business, with the ability \nto accommodate a broad range of \ninfrastructure demands. “HPE GreenLake means we can have \na new service in place with a new \nclient, tested and ready to go within \nfour weeks,” says Jarak. “This is a real \ncompetitive advantage and a world away \nfrom how things were done in the past. Previously, we’d have had to order new \nhardware, wait for delivery, and only then \nstart work. Delivery times were in excess \nof six months.”\nThe ability of the HPE GreenLake \nplatform to absorb fresh demand \nmeans COMLINE avoids having to \nmake long-term commitments to new \nhardware or take up a short-term leasing \narrangement. Both scenarios would add \ncost and inflexibility. “We are confident in our \ngrowth predictions,” says Jarak. “The agreement with HPE provides \na capacity buffer with the promise of \nadditional resources when needed. The bedrock of HPE ProLiant ensures \nwe stay up to date with the latest in \nsecurity, performance, and expandability. Ultimately, the engagement with HPE \nkeeps us out of the logistics of IT and \nallows us to focus on the customer.”\nEvidence of COMLINE’s new approach to \ncustomer service is CACE, the COMLINE \nAny Cloud Environment. For clients, this \nacts as a gateway to a catalog of services \nrun in the COMLINE data centers or \npublic cloud. Clients can self-serve a \nrange of functions, orchestrated by a \nServiceNow ITSM integration; CACE \nthen deploys the service request to the \nappropriate environment. The self-service \napproach has already produced stunning \nefficiency gains: event dispatching \n(98.4%), VM Linux® deployments \n(53.9%), VM resource allocation (47.1%), \nand ticket handling (96%). “It means our consulting and operations \nteams are removed from manual \ntasks and free to focus on providing \nour customers with the best possible \nsolutions and services,” says Schäfer.The migration to the HPE GreenLake \nplatform also underpins a more \nsustainable COMLINE. Jarak says \nGerman businesses already demand \ntransparency on the sustainability \ncredentials of their IT service providers. The sharp rise in energy costs means \nCOMLINE needs to demonstrate how it \nis using energy efficiently. The business \nmade a 5% saving in energy costs \nthrough 2021. He expects this figure to \nincrease as COMLINE takes advantage \nof smarter cloud choices and more \nefficient HPE hardware. “We can now make decisions on where \nto run workloads based on energy \nefficiency and to show these savings \nto clients. Also, automation removes \nmanual interaction,” says Jarak. “We’re \nrunning a highly efficient operation.”\nAccording to Schäfer, automation also \nallows COMLINE to invest in its most \nprecious commodity: people.",

Scientists need to know not only where those habitats are but \nalso how factors like sunlight, temperature, and vegetation influence the \ndelicate balance required to protect the population of waterfowl and other \nwildlife. That’s why Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) takes a science‑based \napproach, leveraging data and technology to inform and track its \nconservation efforts on over 6000 acres across the country. With a \nhybrid cloud environment, the organization is making the most out of \nevery data point, scaling AI models to accelerate insights, and expanding \nits positive impact.

Its efforts to conserve and restore wetlands and other \nhabitats have a positive effect on entire ecosystems, the wildlife \nwithin them, and the communities and visitors of those areas. “We’re interested in climate resilience, carbon sequestration, water \nchemistry, and water quality. These ancillary benefits come along \nwith protecting and restoring wetlands,” says Andrew Pratt, director \nof information technology at DUC. The nonprofit conservancy organization has 500 staff and \nthousands of volunteers supporting scientific research and \nconservation projects through fieldwork, gathering and \nanalyzing data, or fundraising. Science-based conservation\nPratt shares one of DUC’s core principles: “We are a science ‑based \norganization. What we do and where we do it is constantly evolving \nas our science improves, so we can be very focused on the work \nthat we do.”\nAn example of this science ‑based approach is DUC’s decision \nsupport system. This comprehensive map helps identify the critical \nprairie areas to foster positive outcomes, including waterfowl \nbreeding success, considering factors like grassland and wetland \nabundance. This information is then used to drive conservation \npolicies and programs where efforts can be most impactful. All that science and knowledge ‑based information is backed by \nmillions of data points. “We manage 13,500 projects. We have over \n6 million acres in our database, and it’s growing rapidly every year. That’s a lot of data that we have to protect,” says Pratt. “This data \nis used every day by field staff and management, so we have to \nmake it readily available from any place.”\n“Wetlands are very dynamic. If \nyou can collect data on a more \ncontinuous basis, you have a much \ndeeper understanding of what’s \ngoing on.

That data is now starting to flow in through IoT \ndevices into our data centers.”\nFlux towers are one example. These \ndevices monitor gas emissions on wetland \ncomplexes in a continual way. Scientists can \nthen use that data to understand carbon \nstorage processes within the ecosystem, \nand how these are influenced by factors \nlike wetland vegetation abundance and \ntemperature changes through the day and \nseasons. While data collection happens at \nthe edge, all that information needs to be \nprocessed to gain true insights from it. Making donation \ndollars  count\nAs a nonprofit organization, DUC needs \na strong fundraising strategy to get the \nexpertise and technology it needs to \nachieve its objectives. “Data can certainly help us evolve in the \nconservation space, but also in fundraising \nand marketing,” Pratt states. For example, \nDUC can leverage zip code data to learn \nmore about our supporter demographics \nand improve our marketing ROI. The organization must also find ways to drive \nefficiencies and maximize the value of every \nresource it gets. That’s why, when DUC needed \nto modernize its IT environment, it partnered \nwith Hewlett Packard Enterprise to find a \nsolution that aligns with its cloud strategy.“We have to be \nextremely prudent \nin how we’re \nspending our \nunrestricted dollars. HPE GreenLake \ncertainly helps \nwhen we can \nconsolidate some \nof those costs.”  \nAndrew Pratt , Director of Information Technology, Ducks Unlimited Canada\n   Data to the rescue of habitats  |  3\n\n“Dollars are always hard to come by, and the ones \nwe do get often have very stringent requirements \non what can be spent on admin overhead, which \nincludes IT,” relates Pratt. “We have to be extremely \nprudent in how we’re spending our unrestricted \ndollars. HPE GreenLake certainly helps when we \ncan consolidate some of those costs.”\nThe right fit for every workload\nDUC follows a cloud ‑first model, leveraging public \ncloud solutions for enterprise resource planning (ERP), \nHR, sales, and finance functions. This strategy enables \nscalable growth for the organization. Still, Pratt is aware of the workloads and data where public \ncloud is not a good fit. “Cloud offers its benefits, but it’s \nnot always the most cost ‑effective,” he explains. “Our GIS \nworkloads are very large datasets. They’re shared across \nour field offices, there’s a lot of transactional data. So, it \nmakes more sense to run that in our own data centers. That’s what kickstarted this journey.”\nThat journey’s destination was hybrid. By adopting \nHPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition, DUC \ncan run GIS and other workloads on ‑premises while still \ngetting a cloud ‑like experience that is flexible, scalable, \nand easy to manage.",

The solution, which includes \nHPE Alletra dHCI and HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen11 Servers, \ndelivers the storage, compute, and networking the \norganization needs to operate with efficiency.The solution is deployed at DUC’s data centers \nlocated  in Alberta and Manitoba and enables \naccess to data and workloads across its 25 field \noffices and at the edge. “I have a very lean IT team, \nso having HPE GreenLake Private Cloud Business \nEdition really makes the orchestration layer that \nmuch simpler. Everything is nicely displayed for us \nin one pane where I can easily see what’s going on,” \nPratt states. In addition, HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen11 Servers \ndeliver energy efficiency, resource consolidation, and \nhigh performance, supporting DUC’s computational \ndemands for diverse applications while aligning with \nthe organization’s sustainability goals. Intelligence-powered research\nAs science and our knowledge evolve, so do the \ntechnologies that support them. DUC is taking \nadvantage of machine learning to get more precise \nand faster insights. One of the use cases for machine learning is building \na comprehensive inventory of all the wetlands in \nCanada, the only G7 country that doesn’t have a \ncomplete national inventory. “A wetland layer will help us \nunderstand where we are losing or gaining habitat. Using \nthe old methodologies is very manual labor, and that’s \nwhere deep learning AI tools are really coming into their \nown,” Pratt shares. Data to the rescue of habitats  |  4\n\nThese models are running on virtual servers through \nthe HPE GreenLake cloud. The solution also enabled \nPratt and his team to repurpose existing servers for \ncompute ‑heavy remote sensing GIS workloads, which \nalso leverage deep learning tools. Pratt is also looking forward to other ways of adopting \nAI to maximize the value of the research data that \nDUC has amassed throughout more than 85 years of \noperations. “Pushing our data to the cloud to run AI \ntools has made me quite nervous and has slowed our \nAI adoption because of privacy concerns,” he says. “If \nwe can pull all that back and run AI on our own data \ncenters, that is of great appeal to me.”\nSecurity is top of mind\nKeeping all data and workloads secure has increasingly \nbecome a priority for Pratt and his team. “Fundraising \nrequires very sensitive data that falls under certain \nregulations and legislations. From a cybersecurity \nperspective, it’s our most valuable data,” he explains. “So, if I have a choice between sending my team to \nmaintain and manage our storage arrays or implement \nthe latest security tool, I’ll take security every day.”With simplified management and monitoring of its \nprivate cloud environment, DUC can focus its efforts and \nresources on high ‑value tasks. Other factors that strengthen security are HPE Aruba \nNetworking ClearPass, which helps enforce secure \naccess control through role ‑based network policies, \nand HPE Aruba Networking Central, delivering unified \nnetwork management. “A hundred thousand people \ncome through our headquarters every year. It’s a public \nbuilding, so we made sure to protect both the wireless \nand wired networks,” Pratt relates.",

To meet the growing \ndemand for faster, more accurate, and \nseamless services, diagnostic provider \nMedizinisches Labor Nord implemented a \ngeoredundant IT architecture to support \ncontinuous operations. The upgrade is \nenabling the laboratory to process 30% \nmore samples and deliver results faster while \nprotecting patient data. This leads to better \npatient care and a new capacity for growth. Ensuring continuity of crucial diagnostics\nOperational continuity is vital in medical diagnostics, where \nuninterrupted service is essential for delivering timely and accurate \ntest results. As workflows increasingly rely on digital platforms for \ndata processing and storage, laboratories like Medizinisches Labor \nNord face risks from disruptions that can delay results and  \nmedical decisions. This reliability is especially important for Medizinisches Labor Nord \nbecause it handles high volumes of diagnostic samples and serves \nas a regional hub for its parent organization, laboratory diagnostics \nprovider Sonic Healthcare Germany. “Digitalization is very important in laboratory diagnostics right now \nto provide faster diagnoses and improve accuracy of results,” says \nStefan Schmidt, head of IT at Medizinisches Labor Nord. Recognizing the need for modernization, the laboratory identified \nopportunities to transform its operations. By implementing a \ngeoredundant IT infrastructure supported by a secondary data \ncenter, it has achieved 100% system availability and now processes \nup to 10,000 diagnostic samples daily while ensuring robust \ndisaster recovery and secure data backups. “We have a very high-performance system, and we’re now \nprepared for growth,” shares Stefan Schmidt. “We’re no longer \nfocused on what systems to use but instead on expansion  \nand management.”\n\nFuture-proofing operations\nWith an aging IT infrastructure, including outdated \nfirewalls and fragmented storage, Medizinisches Labor \nNord was increasingly vulnerable to disruptions. This \nmade it difficult to manage growing volumes of data, \nadopt new digital healthcare technologies, and ensure \ncontinuous service delivery. “The risks were very high, especially in the firewall \nenvironment,” says Stefan Schmidt. “We were constantly \nfacing new requirements, often daily, that were difficult \nto implement within such an outdated setup.”\nTo safeguard operations and ensure future readiness, \nthe laboratory worked with Hewlett Packard Enterprise \nand channel partner enthus Group to implement a \ncentralized IT infrastructure at a dedicated facility. This \noverhaul combined operations from two smaller data \ncenters into a hub equipped with modern disaster \nrecovery capabilities and scalable systems. Strengthening service resilience\nThe new infrastructure is enabling Medizinisches Labor \nNord to manage current diagnostic workloads more \nefficiently while supporting future growth. Powered by \nHPE Alletra Storage MP B10000, HPE ProLiant DL380 \nGen11 Servers, HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen11 Servers, and \nHPE Apollo 4510 Gen10 Systems — with HPE Aruba \nNetworking CX Switch Series enhancing network \nconnectivity, it provides scalable computing power and \nstorage capacity.

With an upgraded IT environment, Medizinisches Labor \nNord has integrated imaging systems capable  \nof handling large tissue samples and storing  \nterabyte-sized files while providing quick access to \ndata. This supports faster diagnostics, easier external \ncollaboration with healthcare providers, and  \nhigher-resolution imaging. “A single laboratory diagnostic file can be around one \nterabyte,” explains Stefan Schmidt. “These files contain \nsectional samples that must be visualized with precise \nzoom and macro functionality, which requires substantial \nprocessing power. If we can’t deliver data fast enough,  \nit becomes a bottleneck.”\nImproving efficiency and capacity\nWith increased speed and capacity, the laboratory can \nnow process large files while maintaining high standards \nof service. It handles 8,000 to 10,000 diagnostic \nsamples daily and has achieved up to 30% more \nthroughput compared to its previous systems. Stefan Schmidt attributes this improvement largely to the \nnew infrastructure, which is instrumental in accelerating \nthe laboratory’s automation efforts. The upgraded \nnetworking architecture ensures fast and reliable data \naccess, supporting the lab’s automation systems. “Our Roche (cobas) infinity system — the largest ever \nsetup in Germany — relies on our new technology \nplatform to manage complex diagnostic tasks,” he \nsays. “This software solution coordinates workflows for \nautomated diagnostic lines and helps us process large \nvolumes of samples without any issues.”\nHe stresses the importance of speed and performance \nin controlling these workflows. “With our current IT \nenvironment, we have the capacity and flexibility to scale \nas we need.”\nDelivering reliable diagnostics for efficient patient care | 4“We’re\tnow \t\nin\ta\tmuch \t\nbetter \tposition, \t\nespecially \twith\t\t\nour\tbackup \t\nand\trecovery \t\nprocesses.

This raises an interesting question: What’s driving the server mar -\nket toward modularity? A surprisingly major convergence of design \nand development trends is underway, inspired at least in part by les-\nsons learned from transitioning monolithic, on-premises software \nand infrastructures into distributed, cloud-native architectures. Essentially, this means the disaggregation of server hardware follow -\ning the model now typical for cloud-native software design, as shown \nin FIGURE 1. These same gains in agility transfer rather nicely from \nsoftware to hardware. They come in similar fashion, too, by separat-\ning individual subsystems into discrete—including CPU and RAM, \nsecurity, networking, storage, and power supplies—so that engineers \ncan design them independently. Indeed, modular server design is an approach whose time has come, \nand is gaining momentum in hardware design circles. It’s at least \narguable that this approach is a natural evolution of overall sys -\ntems design, as depicted in FIGURE 2. It’s also an approach that is of \n\n 7interest to service providers, who have a keen interest in obtaining, \nusing, and maximizing the return on their ever-growing investment \nin data centers. This not only reflects the growth of data centers for \nconventional and data-intensive workloads, but even for high-per -\nformance computing. It’s also driven strongly by increasing use MONOLITHIC APP\nCLOUD NATIVEClient/Browser\nDatabase(s)Web User Interface\nOrder Management/\nPicking\nPayment\nDelivery\nInventory Management\nUser Interface\nMicroserviceMicroservice\nMicroservice\nMicroservice\nMicroservice\nFIGURE 1: Monolithic apps are giving way to disaggregated collections \nof cloud-based microservices that serve as reusable software parts\n\n 8of artificial intelligence, which consumed a “mere” 14% of global \ndata center power demands in 20201.

All are available at the same time, and \nwork alike in various form factors and designs, so there’s \nno need for separate, custom items. Compatible: Buyers can choose modules from multiple \nmakers, and expect them to work together seamlessly. Likewise, multiple makers can support various form \nfactors and designs. Overall, modular implementations let buyers pick the modules \nthey need to support easy right-sizing for data center servers and \ntheir local infrastructures. Also, replaceable modules improve \nfuture-proofing for devices, because individual modules may be \nswapped out with ease, to take advantage of technology changes and \nCPU speed boosts. This is particularly compelling for power supplies, \nwhere improved efficiency provides immediate value. And finally, \nservice providers and organizations can mix and match individual \ncomponents to deploy modular designs within an open, well-defined, \ntrusted technology ecosystem. All this said, the most important benefit by far is that disaggregation \nmeans modules are not tied to a monolithic development timetable. Thus, modules and related subsystems can evolve independently, so \nthat enterprises and service providers can pick best-of-breed and \noptimally tailored components for their data center needs. OPEN COMPUTE’ S D ATA  CENTER MODULAR HW Sy STEM 14Enterprises and service providers can customize to optimize costs, \nwhile zeroing in on tailored configurations to meet current and pro -\njected workloads. Flexibility and a broad selection of components—\nincluding compute (CPU+RAM), security, storage, networking, and \nmore—lets organizations achieve agility and obtain competitive \nadvantage. As new modules incorporate new or improved technol -\nogies, modularity means accelerated time to market and reusable \ndesigns. This makes it easier than ever before to deploy new services \nand hardware platforms at the same time. The OCP DC-MHS (sub)project aims to standardize and pro -\nvide interoperability between key elements of data center, edge, \nand enterprise infrastructure by offering consistent interfaces \nand form factors among modules. Interoperability also means \ninterchangeability. OCP DC-MHS Overview and \nGuided Tour\nOCP DC-MHS is best understood as a collection of electrical and \nmechanical specifications, where the focus is on designing mod -\nules that seek to improve efficiency, sustainability and scalability of \ndata center servers, racks, and other related devices. In this Gorilla \nGuide, the emphasis is on the server parts of this framework and \nspecifications. Ultimately DC-MHS lets engineering and related firmware and soft -\nware teams concentrate in specific areas of functionality to push such \ndesigns ahead as quickly as they can. This speeds up, separates, and \nsimplifies design cycles. By way of contrast, earlier server designs \nfocused on CPU and RAM generations and architectures, with other \nsystems proceeding concurrently in lockstep. Modularization fosters \ndisaggregation, with each module type subject to its own develop -\nment and update cycles. OPEN COMPUTE’ S D ATA  CENTER MODULAR HW Sy STEM 15Within the DC-MHS framework and specifications, one can find \ndesigns and specifications for  the following types of modules, some \nof which appear in FIGURE 5. M-HPM  (Host Processor Modules): A set of designs \nfor 2U and 4U servers that include one or more CPU \nsockets and various banks of RAM packages.

Service providers and \nenterprises can take advantage of its standardization and interoper -\nability to help them optimize data center operations, expand existing \nmarkets and occupy new ones. All this comes courtesy of the finely \nfocused and tuned capabilities that DC-MHS brings to data centers. This chapter of the Gorilla Guide has covered the general benefits of \nmodular server architecture and design. In Chapter 2, we’ll explore \nwhat gives the Data Center Modular Hardware System its oomph and \nreal value, especially as it pertains to development of certain mod -\nules for which HPE might otherwise have to wait on CPU vendors for \nupdate windows. 17\nThe specifications and designs that make up the DC-MHS \nexpand what system engineers and developers can do when \nbuilding servers. In fact, DC-MHS lets them explore multiple design \nprojects in parallel, each on its own separate timeline and basis. That means CPU and RAM modules (M-HPM) can proceed on one \ntrack, while each such module also gets a Baseboard Management \nController (BMC) to bring in controls for BIOS/UEFI, FPGAs, and so \nforth. But at the same time, work can get underway on a separate \nDC-SCM for remote access, security, monitoring, and management, \nand likewise for storage modules, networking modules, power sup -\nplies, and even advanced functions modules (such as multiple GPUs \nfor AI and other data and computationally intense workloads). It’s \nimportant to emphasize that the DC-MHS specifications ensure \ninteroperability (currently electrical and mechanical) between \nthese modules.

Because HPE leads the market in this space, this is a \nwin for their engineers—and their customers. Design One Time, Reuse as \nNeeded\nEngineers can build modules to fulfill specific server functions, and \nthen use those same modules in different configurations to meet \ndifferent needs, workloads, or use cases. Decoupling modules for \nseparate, discrete development, test, and deployment lets engineers \nfocus on their specific areas of expertise and knowledge, and concen -\ntrate on accommodating newer, faster, and more capable modules on \ntheir own schedules. This offers benefits for certain specific modules \nwhere new technologies get introduced on a rapid cadence—espe -\ncially true for hardware-based security, storage, networking, and \nconnectivity modules (e.g., PCIe 6.0, which is out as of late 2024, and \nPCIe 7.0, currently in design-specification stages). Such technologies \nare especially helpful for servers where more, better, and faster links \nand buses establish important payoffs when advances get put to work \nsooner rather than later. HPE has been part of the OCP since 2015, and is a founding core \nteam member of the DC-MHS project since it launched in 2022. OCP \nDC-MHS offers HPE vital opportunities to deliver its modular serv -\ners, where it can take advantage of faster times to market for new \nmodules and the related capabilities they bring to service providers \nand other data center customers. OCP DC-MHS vetting means that \nHPE’s modular servers arrive in the market with a broad portfolio of \npre-qualified options for the modules it builds into those servers—\nmost notably security, networking, CPU/RAM (DC-HPM), and related \nbaseline controller modules. Why DC-MhS MatterS 19HPE’s Role in DC-MHS\nThe company is contributing upstream with funding and engineering \nsupport for this project. Phillip Leech, senior technologist/architect \nat HPE, leads the DC-MHS Modular Plug-and-Play (M-PnP) work -\nstream. This group focuses on creating standardized interfaces for \nseamless integration of modular components into OCP DC-MHS-\ncompliant servers. The goal is to ensure interoperability between \nhardware modules within those servers, and to support their auto -\nmatic discovery and automated configuration as they’re brought up. Through providing (and adhering) to such standards, M-PnP boosts \nscalability and reduces complexity within data center environments. At the same time, HPE is also working on a full OCP DC-MHS fam -\nily of ProLiant Servers (in both 2U and 4U form factors) so that \ndata center operators can integrate them directly into that overall \narchitecture. Some of HPE’s most interesting work in building DC-MHS modules \ncomes in the area of DC Secure Control Modules (DC-SCMs). Here, the \ncompany is integrating its already well-known and award-winning \nIntegrated Lights-Out (iLO) secure remote access, monitoring, and \nmanagement into the OCP DC-MHS overall architecture. This prom-\nises to make serious, hardware-level security part of what data center \noperators can take as given (and for granted).",

Why DC-MhS MatterS 20HPE Modular Server benefits\nGreater operational flexibility lets enterprises and service provid -\ners adapt faster and better to changing demands, workloads, and \nsoftware stacks.

It includes a Silicon Root of Trust, which \nsafeguards servers against firmware attacks and unautho-\nrized access. iLO supports secure remote monitoring and management of \nserver hardware, via an independent, self-powered module that \nremains remotely accessible even when a server is powered \noff. iLO further supports 2FA and encrypted communications \nprotocols to establish and keep things secure. In addition to providing remote access to one server at a time, \niLO also supports APIs for remote access, monitoring, and con-\ntrol that work with HPE’s OneView platform in the data center, \nand HPE GreenLake in the cloud for automation and site- or \ncloud-wide management. Learn more about how HPE iLO helps \nsafeguard the entire server lifecycle. Why DC-MhS MatterS 21a robust and active technology and partner ecosystem, with assured \nmodule interoperability and integration. Best of all, OCP and DC-MHS \nand their modular approach means modules may be swapped out and \nreused when and as they’re needed. This provides added value for \ninvestments in new technology, now and in the future. Tailored design for any workload comes from modular, open building \nblocks assembled to handle specific workloads. Servers open up and \nbecome vastly more configurable, where buyers can quickly and eas-\nily adopt new technologies as they emerge. Consider what a modular \nserver architecture does for the following Q&A:\n Want a faster CPU and more RAM? Upgrade the \nSC-HPM module (e.g., HPE M-DNO-4 for 1U/2U modules; \nHPE M-FLW for 4U).

Then \nwhen the time is right you can swap or upgrade modules to meet \nchanging demands, add capability or capacity, and more. HPE’s \nvision for the various scenarios are shown in FIGURE 6. In this chapter, you’ve learned the importance of the DC-MHS \narchitecture in enabling flexible, parallel development for server \ncomponents and how with this modular approach different hard -\nware modules, such as CPU, RAM, storage, networking, and power \nsupplies, can be developed and upgraded independently. Next, we’ll \nlook at how modular servers can be managed and operated using \nthe OpenBMC capability that HPE ProLiant Servers support, which \nincludes how HPE iLO improves and expands on those capabilities. 23\nIn the world of OCP data center servers, the Baseboard \nManagement Controller (BMC) manages the HPM module for \nremote access, boot-up and firmware checks, access control \nand data protection, and more. In general, the BMC also provides \nhardware health monitoring, handles firmware updates, and gener -\nally keeps working even when the system is powered off. In a broad \nsense, a BMC does for the DC-MHS architecture what HPE’s iLO (see \nprevious chapter) has done for ProLiant Servers since it was intro -\nduced over 20 years ago. That said, OpenBMC does not replace iLO. HPE provides OpenBMC \nenablement on ProLiant servers. If an organization wishes to pursue \nan OpenBMC strategy on ProLiant servers, HPE enables this capabil -\nity through HPE Transfer of Ownership. Nevertheless, HPE expects \nmost buyers to opt for iLO as the path of greatest security for least \noverall cost.CHAPTER 3\nOpenBMC and  \nModular Servers\n\nOPENBMC AND MODULAR SERVERS 24Basics of OpenBMC\nOpenBMC is an open source firmware stack designed to run on \nDC-MHS baseboard management controllers (usually designated \nM-BMC in that nomenclature). Such controllers seek to enable \nand support simple, efficient server hardware management. The \nOpenBMC project originated with the Linux Foundation, and pro -\nvides a customizable platform for a familiar litany of tasks—namely \nremote monitoring, firmware updates, and system diagnostics. OpenBMC supports standards like Redfish for hardware manage -\nment, and leverages the Yocto Project for building and distribution. OpenBMC is has been adopted in enterprise, high-performance com -\nputing (HPC), and cloud-scale data centers. It’s designed to promote \ninteroperability and flexibility in server management. For further \ninformation on OpenBMC, consult its Wikipedia article or its GitHub \ndocumentation. OpenBMC covers numerous technical management areas. These \ninclude the following:\n Monitoring and management (where applicable) of \nsensors and controls such as voltage and temperature \nin power supplies, and temperature sensors in all kinds \nof devices (e.g., CPU, storage devices, case interior, GPU, \nand so forth). Fan control: Managing cooling systems to establish and \nmaintain optimal operating temperatures. Firmware updates: Enabling secure, remote updates for \nsystem firmware, including IAM, integrity checks, fallback \nrestores, firmware updates, and more. System diagnostics: Monitoring system health and \ndiagnosing potential issues. Security management: Using interfaces like Redfish for \nsecure communications and management. OPENBMC AND MODULAR SERVERS 25 Event logging: Capturing and analyzing system events \nfor troubleshooting, anomaly detection, and auditing. An OpenBMC strategy gives the customer total ownership of their \nBMC firmware, and confers to them the responsibility to design and \nmaintain the features needed for their specific data center environ -\nment.",

Key OpenBMC Features\nIn data center (and other) environments OpenBMC provides the basis \nfor flexibility and added customization, including APIs for remote \naccess, data collection, automation, and control. It offers enhanced \nsecurity, to make sure that servers under its purview can only be \naccessed with appropriate credentials and controls, and that updates \nwill be properly and securely performed only by authorized parties. It’s designed to make data centers more manageable and reliable, and \nto do so cost-effectively without requiring swivel-chair integration \nacross a collection of otherwise unrelated point solutions or individ-\nual consoles or control panels. How HPE’s Modular Servers Play \ninto OCP and OpenBMC\nHPE’s modular ProLiant Servers are designed to align with OCP \nDC-MHS modular systems, and with relevant standards and \nrequirements. These modular servers thus can optionally support \nOpenBMC, as an alternative to HPE’s iLO technology. In general, \nHPE’s ability to work through iLO on a server at a time basis, but also \nthrough HPE OpenView at the data center level, and through HPE \nGreenLake across private and public clouds provide ample scalability, \n\nOPENBMC AND MODULAR SERVERS 26flexibility, automation, and control.

In this chapter, you’ve learned more about how modular servers \nmay be managed and operated, using the OpenBMC option that HPE \nProLiant servers support. You’ve also learned how HPE iLO improves \nand expands on those capabilities. In the next and final chapter, \nwe’ll explore how a major global service provider makes use of OCP \nDC-MHS in its operations, and how HPE modular servers are helping \nthem succeed and thrive. 27\nphoenixNAP  is a global IT service provider that focuses on \nInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and other enterprise-grade IT \ntechnologies and services. A key goal is to commoditize its modular \nserver offerings as part of this portfolio, and make them available to \norganizations of various sizes. Among the company’s broad collection \nof offerings, you’ll find:\n Servers: Dedicated servers are available to organizations \nthat require single-tenant operations with all the options, \nflexibility, and scalability of the cloud. Cloud: Customers can choose among a variety of cloud \ntypes, including managed private cloud, data security \ncloud, hybrid cloud, and more. Backup and restore: Access to various backup \nand recovery options and services, including \ndisaster recovery, multiple backup and recovery \nplatforms, and more. Security: Data security cloud, encryption management \nplatforms, confidential computing services, ransomware \nprotection, and DDOS protection.CHAPTER 4\nCasing A Service \nProvider: phoenixNAP\n\nCASING A SERVICE PROVIDER: PHOENIxNAP 28 Networking services: Geolocation, content delivery \nnetworks, load balancing, routing optimization, QoS, DNS \noptimization, and more.

Simply put: cus-\ntomers need only log into the phoenixNAP platform. They can begin \nto use a dedicated server in less than two minutes, and pay only for \nthe resources they consume. phoenixNAP seeks to be first to market with technologies the com -\npany believes in—especially OCP DC-MHS—made quickly and readily \navailable to customers through a simple, direct consumption-based \nmodel using the latest technologies with the best value. Upgrades and \nmigrations are designed to be simple, easy, and fast. Ideally, migra -\ntions involve little more than changing a set of data pointers from an \nold virtual infrastructure into a new one. Finally, phoenixNAP uses modular servers to meet speed and agility \ndemands of cloud-native, on-premises, and SaaS development cus -\ntomers across multiple markets. That includes advertising technol -\nogy (AdTech), financial technology (FinTech), and state, local, and \neducation (SLED) sectors. Indeed, phoenixNAP has switched from \nmonolithic servers to modular, scalable, pluggable designs in its 18 \nglobal data centers to expand all of its multi-tenant facilities. 4  Martin Wielomski (VP of Products, phoenixNAP), phoenixNAP Becomes the First in the \nWorld to Deploy a High-Performance, Power-Efficient Solution for Cloud-Native, Scale-\nOut Compute Workloads, November 2024\n\nCASING A SERVICE PROVIDER: PHOENIxNAP 29Modular Building Blocks Empower \nExpanding Services and \nConsumption Models\nIndeed, phoenixNAP was HPE’s first customer for DC-MHS modular \nservers. From the get-go, the impetus was to deploy reusable build -\ning blocks for multiple designs across multiple markets and business \nmodels. HPE’s disaggregated servers make data centers interopera -\nble and compatible, thanks to consistent interfaces and form factors \nexplicitly engineered for security from silicon all the way through to \nsoftware. A key principle is that phoenixNAP’s IaaS platform speeds \nproduct introductions, by obviating ground-up custom designs, and \nreduced TCO from modular innovations and sourcing across the \nentire HPE partner ecosystem. Mr. Peter Groth, HPE VP, GM, and CTO for Service Providers, says \nof this effort: “Service providers are investing in next-generation \ninfrastructure to address evolving enterprise IT requirements across \nnew workload demands, heightened security concerns, and flexibility \nneeds as businesses scale or change.” He continues “phoenixNAP is \non the leading edge of delivering modernized, advanced solutions and \nwe are thrilled to continue our partnership to power its cloud services. By leveraging the new HPE ProLiant Gen12 servers that deliver next-\nlevel security, performance, and efficiency, phoenixNAP is offering \nits customers a trusted, scalable, and versatile solution to fuel a new \nera of innovation.” In short, HPE’s new modular DC-MHS servers are \npowering delivery of high-performance, always-available infrastruc-\nture that work with cloud-like ease and simplicity, to bring apps and \nworkloads closer to DevSecOps teams and users alike.",

In the Windows world, PnP provides reasonable expectations that \ncompatible devices may be plugged into a suitable connection and \n“just work.” For DC-MHS servers, M-PnP envisions a suitably engi-\nneered runtime environment where compatible modules get plugged \nin, get discovered, and (where necessary) properly configured by \nsome kind of BMC or related agent, and do the very same thing—that \nis, they “just work.”\nThis could enable truly mix-and-match server configuration, where \nany combination of the right modules could be relied upon to come \ntogether and act like a complete data center server. This would allow \norganizations to put modules together as needed to handle work -\nloads. But it would also allow organizations to upgrade modules \nwithout replacing servers outright. This would be especially useful \nfor independent upgrades to CPU and memory modules, security \nmodules, storage modules, networking connections, and more effi -\ncient power supplies. With that kind of reusability, sustainability, and \nenergy efficiency, it opens new and better ways to build and operate \ndata centers, and the servers that make them run. CASING A SERVICE PROVIDER: PHOENIxNAP 31Advancing at Full Speed\nModular servers decouple the development of server modules for \nsecurity, storage, networking, and so forth, from dependence and \ntiming of upstream CPU vendors. This allows new technologies to \nadvance at full speed, with the ability to replace older modules with \nnewer ones as available and support for flexibility, scalability, and \nefficiency. This is especially important for security, storage, and net -\nworking, which typically advance on a more rapid cadence than CPUs. 32\nABOUT HPE\nHPE is the global edge-to-cloud company built to \ntransform your business.

HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 servers with HPE iLO 7 help you \noutsmart evolving risks so you can stay focused on what matters. The case for modern server security\nToday’s threat landscape wears more disguises. Those threats can \ncome from unexpected angles with tactics that are harder to spot—let alone \nstop—with attacks increasingly targeting firmware and supply chains. Secure \ninfrastructure means protecting every layer at every moment of its lifecycle, \nwhile keeping up with compliance demands and operational complexity. But traditional defenses like firewalls and endpoint tools weren’t designed \nto address what happens before the OS boots or when servers sit idle. And \nit’s increasingly unrealistic for manual security processes such as patching, \nupdates, and configuration management to keep up with the speed and \nscale of modern operations. The result? Gaps that quietly grow across hybrid and multi-gen \nenvironments. IT decision-makers are confronted with a variety of questions: How do you \nsecure what isn’t always visible? What’s the long-term cost of drifting out of \ncompliance? How do you modernize infrastructure without adding new risk \nor burden? The first step is moving from layered security to embedded protection—built \ninto the platform, future-ready, and active from day one. Take control with a platform built for security at \nevery layer\nKeeping infrastructure secure gets harder as environments expand across \nsites, workloads, and deployment models. HPE’s leadership in server security \nis built on decades of innovation—from silicon root of trust to secure boot to \ncomplete lifecycle protection. Advanced features that expand \nplatform protection: \n —Secure enclave architecture for \nencryption key isolation\n —Real-time dashboards for \nthreat detection\n —Configuration locks and \nTLS-only encryption\n —Machine-specific \nfirmware verification\n —Active security even when the \nserver is powered off\nThese capabilities deliver built-in \nintelligence that starts protecting \nbefore the OS even boots.With HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12, that foundation gets even stronger. HPE iLO 7 represents the next step in this evolution, giving IT teams powerful, \nbuilt-in tools to detect threats early, enforce policies consistently, and \nrespond quickly when something goes wrong. Rather than layering security on top of the stack, HPE integrates it at every \nlevel. HPE iLO 7 runs on its own isolated silicon and remains active even when \nthe host OS is down, giving teams continuous insight into server health, \nintegrity, and exposure. The new secure enclave architecture stores credentials safely and helps \nprevent tampering. Meanwhile, real-time dashboards, machine-specific \nfirmware updates, and configuration locks make secure operations easier to \nmaintain at scale. By bringing together hardware, firmware, and management in one resilient \nplatform, you can modernize with confidence, knowing security is already \nbuilt in and ready to support you from day one. A simple path to strong protection \nUpgrading infrastructure often comes with concerns about disruption, \ninconsistency, or management overhead. But HPE iLO 7 is designed to \nease that transition, making secure operations easier to maintain across \nmixed environments. With its real-time dashboards, machine-specific firmware validation, and \ncentralized credential control, HPE iLO 7 gives IT teams greater confidence \nthat policies are enforced and threats are visible, no matter how fast the \nenvironment grows.",

Don’t let aging servers stall enterprise innovation  |  2While technology continues to advance at a dizzying \npace, one fact remains unchanged: Organizations \nthat innovate faster and more efficiently than their \ncompetition are the ones that will prevail. But achieving \nhigh levels of innovation sometimes requires business \nleaders to break with tradition and make bold choices. At the same time, demands on IT have never \nbeen greater. Tech teams are being asked to meet \never-increasing computing needs of the AI-driven \nenterprise while also supporting non-AI workloads; \nat higher performance, accelerated pace comprises \nmost day-to-day digital operations. And they’re \nexpected to fulfill the current or projected needs in the \nmost cost -efficient way possible—while also meeting \norganizational sustainability goals. Achieving these outcomes requires an approach that \nfocuses on rapid infrastructure modernization. While \ntraditional hardware refresh cycles of three to five \nyears have served enterprises well for decades, we’re \nnow in an era in which the benefits of more frequent \nmodernization efforts significantly outweigh the costs. Simply put, older, multigenerational servers struggle \nto handle the performance demands of modern \nworkloads. Plus, these aging systems are likely harder \nto manage and more costly to operate; they’re also \nless energy efficient and lack the future-ready security \nfeatures delivered by the latest HPE ProLiant Gen11 and \nHPE ProLiant Compute Gen12 servers. Yes, your aging infrastructure may still be operational, \nbut for how long and at what additional impact to your \nbottom line? Accelerating your refresh cycle can keep \nyou from falling behind in areas most crucial to the \nsuccess of your enterprise.Greater performance for \ndemanding workloads and AI‑driven \nuse cases\nWhile performance has always been the primary \nconsideration for choosing servers, it takes on increased \nimportance in an era where outstanding execution \ndelivers faster, better results. It’s estimated that by \n2030, the demand for data center capacity is likely to \nincrease by up to 27%, with AI workloads accounting \nfor roughly a third of that total.1 Additionally, with the \ncontinued demand for VDI and the emergence of \nAI workloads—and the need for inference at the  \nedge—performance speed has never been \nmore important. The HPE ProLiant Gen11  server achieved 60 records for \nperformance against industry-recognized benchmarks, \nincluding three for compute-intensive workloads.2 \nHolding multiple world records in AI inferencing \nbenchmarks, The  HPE ProLiant Compute Gen12  \nis even more powerful, delivering lower latency \ncommunications,3 and featuring the Intel® Xeon® 6 \nprocessor with nearly 2.5 times as many cores per \nCPU as Gen11.

Full asset lifecycle sustainability, from design to packaging and IT asset disposition , \nalso figure heavily in product favorability. In many industry sectors, IT expenditures can claim a large investment. In these same sectors, IT infrastructure  \nsuch as compute, storage, and network resources can be a large source of carbon emissions. Against this backdrop, recent Enterprise Strategy Group research found that 56% of organizations surveyed \nreported that IT was a leader in driving sustainability initiatives in their firms, followed by executive functions ( 39%) \nand dedicated environmental, social, and governance executive teams  (32%) . Clearly, achieving sustainability goals is a key initiative for most major organizations, and IT technology and \noperations should be considered one of the most straightforward paths to achieve that result.

Trusted security by designFrom silicon to software, from factory to cloud, and from generation to generation, HPE ProLiant is engineered with a fundamental  security approach to defend against \nincreasingly complex threats through an uncompromising  focus to deliver constant security \nadvancements that’s built into our DNA. Protect  your infrastructure, workloads, and data \nfrom threats to hardware, and risks from third-party software, with a trusted edge-to-cloud security posture built on an HPE compute core hardened through a proven, zero trust approach to security. HPE ProLiant provides an enhanced holistic, 360-degree view to security that begins in the manufacturing supply chain and concludes with a safeguarded, end-of-life decommissioning. •Secure supply chain:  HPE ProLiant security begins with the corruption-free manufacture of\nthe server, auditing the integrity of every component — hardware and firmware — providingan assurance that the server begins its lifecycle uncompromised. •Silicon root of trust: It anchors the essential firmware of HPE ProLiant to an ASIC evenbefore the server is built, creating an immutable fingerprint that must be exactly matchedbefore the server will boot. This helps ensure malicious code is contained and healthyservers are protected. •Server configuration lock:  Secured by a customer-supplied password, server\nconfiguration lock creates a digital fingerprint of the server configuration, preventing it frombooting should there be an unauthorized configuration change or tampering detected. •Security dashboard:  A single interface to display the overall server security status, the\ncurrent configuration for the security state, and server configuration lock plus the statusof numerous security features, the security dashboard also provides access to changesecurity alerts and manage settings. •Production to CNSA security modes: Equipped with HPE iLO, HPE ProLiant providesfour security modes — production, high security, FIPS 140-2, and Commercial NationalSecurity Algorithm (CNSA) (the highest-level cryptographic algorithm available forcommercial systems). •Server system restore:  Should a server be compromised, the fastest path to bring it back\nonline and into normal operations again is with HPE server system restore, a feature ofHPE iLO. Server system automated recovery includes restoration of validated firmware,facilitated recovery of the operating system, application, and data connections. •One button secure erase:  When it’s time to retire or repurpose an HPE ProLiant server,\none button secure erase speeds and simplifies the complete removal of passwords,configuration settings, and data, preventing inadvertent access to previously securedinformation.

Our \nflagship product, Bare Metal Cloud , offers businesses the ability \nto deploy and manage high performance physical servers with \ncloud -like ease and simplicity. Part of our success comes from our ability to keep pace with \nour customers’ evolving requirements and needs. For example, \nwe’ve automated deployments and introduced edge-to-cloud \ncomputing to our product portfolio. We’ve also seen that AI is \ntransforming how clients consume data center resources. This \npushed us to optimize our server portfolio to better accommodate \nmodern, data-intensive workloads such as AI training and \ninferencing or high performance computing (HPC). To meet evolving market demands and empower clients with \ncomprehensive IT infrastructure solutions, partnering with \nreliable, innovative hardware vendors is essential. Hewlett Packard \nEnterprise is one of our key partners, helping us deliver automated, \ndedicated infrastructure solutions—not only to our clients but also \nto our internal teams handling updates, storage and compute \nconfigurations, and server troubleshooting. At the end of the day, \nthe more we automate everything, the more room we have for \nstrategic planning and adding value to our products. – Martin Wielomski , VP of Products, phoenixNAP\nphoenixNAP becomes the first in the world to deploy a high performance, power-efficient solution for cloud-native, scale-out compute workloads | 2\n\n\nRecognizing the importance of \ninfrastructure modernization\nAs VP of products at phoenixNAP, I spearhead \nproduct innovation from our Amsterdam office. I oversee the evolution of our infrastructure and \nautomated provisioning platform, ensuring we deliver \nmarket -leading IT solutions that empower clients \nworldwide. We take pride in our solution enabling clients \nto automatically provision and manage bare metal \nservers in minutes through API, CLI, or WebUI. However, \nour excellent partnership with HPE helped us continue \nto be one of the first to deliver as-a-service access to \nnext-gen server technologies. We were already using HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers with \n5th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors. We were \nalso offering Arm®-based server instances powered by \nHPE ProLiant RL300 Gen11 servers, which helped us \nventure outside the x86 ecosystem. In short, I already \nknew that HPE had a future-forward mindset that could \nhelp us further update our infrastructure to provide the \nprocessing power and energy efficiency our clients \ndemand. I was looking forward to gaining access to their \ncutting-edge hardware and offering it to clients who \ndemand maximum performance and optimal power \nmanagement for their cloud-native workloads. As it turned out, HPE was preparing to release its Gen12 \nservers featuring the latest, Intel Xeon 6 processors. These \nnew chips boasted significant gen-on-gen performance \ngains and offered advanced power management features \nthat substantially reduce energy consumption.",

These \nnew chips boasted significant gen-on-gen performance \ngains and offered advanced power management features \nthat substantially reduce energy consumption. As such, \nthey were the perfect mix of increased CPU core count \nand throughput our clients required. We wanted a modular, open approach at the hardware \nlayer to increase core density, reduce workload costs, \nand simplify our infrastructure operations across our fleet. Confident in HPE’s capabilities, we were the first customer \nin the world to order HPE ProLiant DL320 Gen12 SP \nservers, and the benefits of the upgrade were immediate. Increased automation for easier \nmaintenance\nWe aim to avoid having dozens of IT team members \nspending endless hours installing updates, deploying \nservers, and managing infrastructure. The new \nHPE servers allowed us to further enhance our \nautomation-driven operations. With HPE ProLiant servers, \na single engineer can handle everything with a few clicks \nand this seamlessly aligns with our existing workflows. Using HPE iLO , my team can remotely manage our \nHPE ProLiant servers anywhere in the world. I can limit \naccess to a select group of IT administrators who can \nconnect to servers across our global network instead of \ngoing on-site to troubleshoot or plug in an Ethernet cable. “ Our infrastructure is their \ninfrastructure, and we want our \nclients to feel confident that we \ncan scale to accommodate their \nbusiness as they expand.”  \n– Martin Wielomski , VP of Products, phoenixNAP\nphoenixNAP becomes the first in the world to deploy a high performance, power-efficient solution for cloud-native, scale-out compute workloads | 3\n\nThey can even reboot and restore servers that are asleep \nor that have crashed—and all of this saves us time, effort, \nand ongoing operational expenses. Our clients rely on phoenixNAP to deliver compute, \nstorage, and network capacity wherever and whenever \nneeded. They rely on our infrastructure to scale, and \nHPE iLO makes it easier for us to monitor and manage \nequipment and quickly deploy their systems remotely. After all, our infrastructure is their infrastructure, and \nwe want our clients to feel confident that we can \naccommodate their business as they expand. Supporting an influx of \nAI infrastructure\nPartnering with HPE enabled phoenixNAP to expand our \nbusiness and make tomorrow’s technology available to \nanyone while continuing to support our enterprise SaaS, \nFinTech, AdTech, and SLED clients. These companies \nare likely to embrace AI in the coming years through \nsmall- to mid-size retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) \ntechnology—if they haven’t already. This technology will \nenhance the accuracy and reliability of their models with \nexternal data, and we will be able to support their data \nprocessing needs with our new HPE ProLiant DL320 \nGen12 SP servers with Intel Xeon 6 technology. Our next step is to install additional HPE ProLiant \nservers featuring Intel Xeon 6 CPUs at our data centers. These units will provide additional capacity while being \ncustomized and validated for servers using NVIDIA® \nGPUs, the industry standard for AI applications. Using \nHPE technology, we are currently meeting 70–80% of our \ncustomers’ processing needs. Once these new servers \nare deployed, we will be able to handle even more.
