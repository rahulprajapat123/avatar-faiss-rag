  "text": "Secure your data with HPE GreenLake\nSecurity solutions\nAre you concerned with the risk of a security breach in an ever changing landscape of threats and attacks? Do you need security built into everything?\nWe can help you to adopt a zero trust framework so that you can close gaps and reduce complexity. That's built-in security, wisely done.\nHow security is evolving as companies adopt hybrid cloud \nWhich cloud solutions do users think are best for security? Our survey might surprise you.\nLearn why customized security strategies are crucial for your organization's protection.\nMeet the right security standards \nThe lifeblood of your business is the data you generate, transform, store, and move. Take a silicon-to-cloud approach to securing your data infrastructure spanning clouds, data centers, and edges while also helping to protect against ransomware attacks.\nPonemon Institute: Security strategies to close security gaps and protect valuable data in the AI era \nThe increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and the accelerating adoption of AI make it more important than ever to become aggressive in closing security gaps in IT infrastructure. The 2025 Ponemon Institute study discusses security strategies that high-performing teams use to reduce risk in an edge-to-cloud world.\nGet security confident \nUltimately, security is about enabling risk to allow your business to grow confidently knowing that your valuable data and assets are protected against threats. We're building security into everything we do to help protect your digital supply chain, embedding security technologies into HPE GreenLake to automatically attest to the integrity of your data infrastructure, making it easier to ensure security and compliance. We also enable you to protect your organization against prevalent cyberattacks, like ransomware, with comprehensive solutions designed to reduce risk, improve security posture, and enhance resilience.\nComprehensive ransomware protection \nRansomware defense can be challenging. Sophisticated and well-funded cybercriminals often target high-profile organizations, conducting surveillance to effectively attack vulnerable users and even third-party service providers with access to data from many different organizations. Effective ransomware protection requires layering defenses so you can detect attacks early to protect against damage and accelerate ransomware recovery. Find out how HPE networking and security solutions provide multilayered defense and air-gapped cyber recovery to stop ransomware in its tracks.\nContinuous data protection \nAttacks on your business are inevitable, but recovery is not. Minutes matter to you, your customers, and your shareholders. Getting back up and running quickly is now more critical than ever. HPE's continuous data protection capabilities deliver always-on replication instead of periodic snapshots. You can \"rewind\" from incidents within a window of seconds, not just minutes. Our built-in encryption capabilities allow you to rest assured that your backup data is protected no matter where you place it.\nContinuous data protection is the key to business survival \nRansomware attacks can cripple your business. A new approach called continuous data protection offers quick recovery from significant data losses.\nAdopt the principles of a zero trust framework \nAutomated computing technologies will allow you to react to the needs of your global customers more quickly. But these technologies also enable attackers to just as easily compromise the fidelity of your data infrastructure without you even knowing they were there. With HPE GreenLake employing a zero trust-enabled architecture from edge to cloud, we \"know\" when something is malicious or insecure - continuously learning and adapting to stay ahead of emerging threats. We constantly and automatically verify the integrity of your hardware, operating systems, virtualization systems and workloads so that you can make timely security decisions.\nZero trust security: A new approach to security architecture \nCybercrimes cost the world trillions of dollars every year. Defend your business against relentless attacks with robust security solutions.\nEmpowering caregivers, securely, at Enloe Medical Center\nAt Enloe Medical Center, technology is the backbone for all caregivers. With multiple applications feeding data into their electronic medical records, it's imperative that these systems and technologies function seamlessly and consistently.\nLearn how Enloe Medical Center consolidated its IT infrastructure into a single, modern environment that’s both reliable and secure.\nFeatured security products \nSecurity, risk, and compliance \nProtect your business from evolving threats with the right tools and skills.\nHPE Edge-to-Cloud Adoption Framework \nProven methodology to accelerate and de-risk your transformation to a cloud operating model across all your IT.\nHPE GreenLake Management Services \nServices that monitor, operate, and optimize your infrastructure and applications, delivered consistently and globally to give you unified control and let you focus on innovation.\nHPE solutions from edge to cloud \nExplore the ways HPE can help you open up opportunities across edge to cloud.\nUnlock AI potential \nSimplify AI and deliver impactful results. \nConnect your enterprise \nConnect, protect, and deliver seamless experiences. \nTransform data into insights \nIntegrate, manage, and govern data efficiently. \nModernize hybrid cloud \nGain flexible, modern cloud control. \nSecure your IT estate \nEnhance security, reduce complexity."

  "text": "GreenLake Intelligence | HPE India\nSupercharge your IT operations with a mesh of intelligent AI agents—acting like a 24/7 intelligent operations team that can reason to solve problems across your hybrid IT estate. It’s like giving your infrastructure the ability to think, learn, and act—so your teams can move faster, reduce risk, and unlock more value from your data.\nAntonio Neri announces GreenLake Intelligence at HPE Discover 2025 \nA short demonstration of GreenLake Intelligence \nDeep intelligence where it matters \nAI agents trained to understand enterprise IT from workloads to infrastructure and act on your intent.\nBreak down the silos \nAgents solve problems across layers and domains, working together with continuity and context.\nBring the opportunities to you \nAlways-on, proactive recommendations enable intelligent optimization.\nAction, not just answers \nEliminate manual tasks with autonomous IT. Agents take action, subject to your approval.\nWhat collective intelligence looks like \nMultiple, domain-specific LLMs trained on HPE data to form an agentic mesh capable of learning and acting to automate processes, workflows, and prevent IT problems before they occur—across clouds, domains, tools, and tasks.\nGreenLake Intelligence in action \nTake a look at these example use cases we are enabling with GreenLake Intelligence to get a feel for how multi-domain agentic AI can accelerate your IT.\nDiagnosing an app performance issue\nWorkload optimization and orchestration\nProactive issue resolution\nOnboarding a new device\nYou have purchased a new network switch and need to onboard it to your GreenLake workspace. Instead of clicking through the user interface for adding a device, which involves several screens, you ask the assistant to add a device for you. It prompts you to provide the serial number and MAC address of the device, then determines the appropriate subscription and management service to attach to it. You simply view and approve a summary of what will be done to add the device, and AI agents do the rest.\nThe mesh is open to more stitches \nGreenLake Intelligence is compliant with standard AI protocols such as Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling you to connect it with other agents and devices. Your ITSM system could collaborate with GreenLake to fully automate the implementation of tickets. You could bring your third-party infrastructure under GreenLake management. In other words, our agentic mesh is open to more stitches. And the work is not all on your shoulders: HPE plans to work with its ecosystem of technology partners to create specific agentic integrations.\nHPE channel partners benefit too \nFor HPE channel partners, GreenLake Intelligence unlocks many new opportunities for value creation. With it, partners can deliver smarter, higher-margin services—from proactive optimization to autonomous operations—without adding headcount. You´ll help your customers move from managing infrastructure to orchestrating outcomes. And because the system is modular and extensible, partners can build, brand, and monetize your own domain-specific agents, integrations, and copilots: creating differentiated offerings and deepening loyalty with every deployment.\nRelated resources \nHPE reimagines hybrid IT operations with GreenLake Intelligence \nHPE press release announcing GreenLake Intelligence.\nGreenLake Intelligence: HPE’s Vision for AI-Driven IT Operations \nBlog article by Hybrid Cloud/AI CTO Brian Gruttadauria explaining what GreenLake Intelligence is and why it matters to IT teams."
