As part of this, COMLINE wants to migrate services out of its data centers into a new private cloud. This will build flexibility, scale, and commercial control while enabling German data to stay in Germany.",

    "text": "ry diagnostic file can be around one terabyte, explains Stefan Schmidt. These files contain sectional samples that must be visualized with precise zoom and macro functionality, which requires substantial processing power. If we cant deliver data fast enough, it becomes a bottleneck. Improving efficiency and capacity With increased speed and capacity, the laboratory can now process large files while maintaining high standards of service. It handles 8,000 to 10,000 diagnostic samples daily and has achieved up to 30% more throughput compared to its previous systems.",

Closed-loop liquid cooling functions like a server-contained radiator akin to a cars engine cooling system. Completely integrated into the computers chassis, cool liquid is piped to cold plates atop CPUs and draws off heat. The warm liquid flows through a heat exchanger that is cooled by air in motion. Once cooled, it returns to the cold plates. DLC improves power usage effectiveness (PUE) and cuts cooling expenses in a fully rack- contained and integrated water-cooled system.",

This information is then used to drive conservation policies and programs where efforts can be most impactful.
